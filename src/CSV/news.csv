I could be rested for a match - Westwood
38th Ryder Cup
Venue: Celtic Manor, Newport Date: 1-3 October Starts: 0745 BST on Friday Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live & online, live text commentary online & daily highlights on BBC TWO. Live on Sky Sports 1
Lee Westwood says he is ready to lead by example when he begins the European team's bid to win back the Ryder Cup from the United States at Celtic Manor.
Westwood has been paired with Martin Kaymer against Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in the first fourball.
""If I get out there - chest out, chin up - I've got the most experience and will try to show them how it's done,"" said the 37-year-old from Worksop.
The world number three has overcome a calf injury to play in his seventh Cup.
European team captain Colin Montgomerie revealed Westwood asked to follow Mickelson and Johnson's tee shots as part of the first group to tee off at 0745 BST on Friday.

And earlier on Thursday, Westwood had spoken publicly of his desire to get Europe of to a flying start in their pursuit of the 14.5 points needed to wrestle the trophy from the United States.

Harrington reveals mentor role
""I'm going to go out there and try and hit the first fairway in my match. Try and knock it on the green, try and win that first hole, try and win a point that first morning,"" he said ahead of Thursday's announcement of the opening day's pairings.
Westwood had been surprisingly teamed up with rookie Rory McIlroy during final practice on Thursday, but Montgomerie resisted any temptation to spring a surprise and instead selected the 21-year-old Northern Ireland player alongside fellow countryman Graeme McDowell in the day's second group.
The 2009 Open champion Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar will form the opposition for McIlroy and McDowell.
Westwood has not played competitively in two months because of his calf problem, with his last tournament the Bridgestone Invitational back in early August.
When asked whether his injury had made him a doubt for the clash in Wales, Westwood responded: ""Yes, it did.
""I think when you go through a rehabilitation process, some weeks it moves quickly, other weeks, you don't see much of an improvement.

Westwood says his calf injury is not an issue and is ready to play all five matches if needed
Rob Hodgetts at Celtic Manor
""It's a bit like building a house, if you go back every day, you don't see much of a change.
""It's just because it's something that I've never been through before and you don't know what to expect. It's a bit like being a rookie on the Ryder Cup team.""
Westwood admitted that the steep slopes on the Twenty Ten course and possibility of playing 36 holes a day would test his fitness, but added that he was confident of staying the pace.
""I wouldn't be here if I don't think I could play five matches,"" he added.
""So if Monty [Montgomerie] chooses to play me for five, then hopefully I'll be ready for it.
""I think we've got a strong enough team that we can rest players. It is a tough course physically and maybe the plan would be to rest players.""
Westwood, who made his Ryder Cup debut under Seve Ballesteros in 1997, has played 29 matches.
In foursomes, Westwood has six wins and three halves from 11 matches, while in fourballs his return is six wins and two halves from 12.
Europe's number one will leapfrog American Phil Mickelson to take the world number two spot next week - with only Tiger Woods standing between himself and the number one spot.

Monty reveals Seve's Ryder rallying call
Europe team-mate and another Ryder Cup rookie Peter Hanson has been given at least Friday morning to recover from a chest infection that forced him to pull out of last week's Vivendi Cup with a chest infection.
The Swede, along with Miguel-Angel Jimenez and Edoardo and Francesco Molinari, have been left out of the opening day's fourball action.
""I am feeling a lot better,"" stated 32-year-old Hanson, who is one of six debutants in Montgomerie's team.
""I had a bad cold that went down close to the lungs and into there, so it was a good decision to rest.
""I came here on Monday still not feeling great, but I have to say that from Tuesday morning to now it feels good.""
Hanson also commented on how the new experience of playing at the Ryder Cup would affect him.
""I think everybody is going to be nervous. It's hard as a rookie because you don't really know what to expect, but we have all been in positions,"" he added.
""Every time you get put in a new situation, I think you get that extra bit of nerve.
""I remember the first European Tour event I played on home soil in Sweden.

""I played as an amateur, and the feeling walking on to that first tee pretty close to where I live with packed grandstands all the way down, I think that feeling is going to be something similar to this.""
Tension is also something that Miguel-Angel Jimenez said he has been experiencing, despite the fact the Spaniard is set to make his fourth appearance in the competition.
""It's very tense, especially because it's getting so close now,"" said Jimenez, who at 46 is the oldest player on the 12-man Europe team.
""When you get here to the Ryder Cup, all week you feel like a knot in your stomach and tomorrow is getting closer and your knot is getting tight.""
He added: ""It's a good thing, yeah,"" he said. ""It's not nerves. It's something that you can afford, that you want.
""That makes you motivated more, and that's where you want to be. If you don't have those feelings, probably you're not here [in a good state of mind]. You need to feel things and that is important to you.""

2;"Angry cyclist Alberto Contador pleads innocence

Contador blames food contamination
Three-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador has claimed he is the victim of contaminated food after testing positive for a banned drug.
The muscle-building and fat-burning drug clenbuterol was detected in his system during this year's Tour.
Contador, 27, the greatest rider of his generation, said that contaminated meat brought in from Spain was responsible for his positive test on 21 July.
""It is a clear case of food contamination,"" stated the Spaniard.
Contador, who called himself a ""victim"", has been provisionally suspended by cycling's world governing body the UCI after his A and B samples tested positive.
A World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited lab in Cologne, Germany, found a ""very small concentration"" of clenbuterol in Contador's urine sample on 21 July at the Tour, according to the UCI.
Spain's Alberto Contador is cycling's biggest star
However, the amount was 400 times less than the 50 picogram benchmark measurement that anti-doping laboratories accredited by Wada must be able to detect.
BBC Radio 5 live's cycling reporter Simon Brotherton said that if the test failure is upheld, Contador could be stripped of his Tour de France title and also given a two-year ban from the sport as a first offender.
""But it sounds to me as if the UCI feels it's such a miniscule amount, and not one that would have potentially made any difference [to his performance], that it is keen to get to the bottom of this and feels it is worth investigating the claims Contador has made,"" he added.
The only previous Tour winner to be stripped of their title was Floyd Landis in 2006.
The American's allegations about drug use in the sport are part of an ongoing investigation by federal authorities in the United States.
Contador, who in August joined Bjarne Riis's Team Saxo Bank on a two-year deal after leaving the Astana team, said the meat was brought across the border from Spain to France during a rest day during the Tour.
He said there were complaints about the food at the hotel where his Astana team were staying.
The Spaniard revealed he ate the meat on 20 July and again on 21 July and at a specially arranged news conference in his home town of Pinto, he called the UCI's suspension of him ""a true mistake"".
He claimed: ""The UCI itself affirmed in front of me that it was a case of food contamination.
""This is a genuine mistake. I think it will be resolved in a clear way, with the truth up front,"" he said but added that the UCI ""understands that is a special case, which has to be examined"".
The rider, who appeared tense and sometimes on the verge of tears, stated he was ""sad and disappointed but with my head held high"".
He added: ""I've spent a month and half keeping this inside, without sleeping. My family didn't find out until last night.
""This is a real error. The system is very questionable and it has to be changed. I cannot tolerate the idea of a possible sanction.""
Contador's suspension is a huge blow to the sport, which has fought hard in the past few years to fight widespread doping by riders that has repeatedly sullied the Tour, its showpiece race.
Despite his protestations, the failed test threatens to leave an indelible stain on the record of the Spaniard, who also won the 2007 and 2009 Tours.
It makes no sense because it would have come up in other [doping] controls
David Millar
But British world time trial silver medallist David Millar backed Contador as a ""fantastic athlete and a great human being"" and believes the case should never have been made public because further investigation is needed.
Millar, who was banned from cycling for two years in 2004 after admitting to using the blood-booster EPO earlier in his career, feels there are a lot of questions that need to be answered before judging Contador.
""I think there's a very strong chance that this is being blown way out of proportion... because it's a micro-dose and it was on a rest day,"" said the Scot.
""It makes no sense because it would have come up in other [doping] controls. It's a shame that it has been released when it hasn't been resolved. It's something that should be resolved behind closed doors.
""There are strict rules and I think unfortunately in cycling, for the right reasons, we always jump to the worst-case scenario and because of the history we have in the sport unfortunately maybe Alberto's been thrown to the sharks.
""I think it will get resolved, and I hope so for Alberto's benefit and I hope so for the sport's benefit.""
Clenbuterol can strip fat and enhance muscle size and can also have a short-term stimulant effects, including increasing aerobic capacity, blood pressure and alertness. It has led to bans for cyclists in the past.
In similar ways to stimulant drugs such as amphetamine or ephedrine, it can increase the heart rate and body temperature.
Contador earned his third Tour de France victory this year
Athletes and body builders are thought to use it in combination with other performance-enhancers such as growth hormone and steroids to build and define muscles.
It is listed by Wada as an anabolic agent that is prohibited for use by athletes at all times, both in and out of competition.
American swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for clenbuterol at the US trials in July 2008 and served a one-year suspension that ended last summer.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport later accepted her explanation that she had unknowingly taken it in a contaminated food supplement.
A number of athletes have been suspended in recent months after using the banned drug, including Polish canoeist Adam Seroczynski, British hurdler Callum Priestley and Chinese Olympic judo champion Tong Wen.
In May, the UCI suspended Italy's Alessandro Colo after he tested positive for clenbuterol during the Tour of Mexico in April.
And Chinese rider, Li Fuyu, a member of Lance Armstrong's Team RadioShack, was suspended in April after testing positive for the drug during a Belgian race.

After a run of six successive victories to start their Premier League and Champions League campaigns in emphatic fashion, the Blues were knocked out of the Carling Cup following a 4-3 home defeat by Newcastle on 22 September.
Three days later, the west Londoners lost 1-0 at Manchester City, their first league loss since the same opposition beat them at Stamford Bridge on 27 February.
Despite that setback at Eastlands, Ancelotti's men remain top of the Premier League table, three points clear of second-place Manchester United and four points ahead of Arsenal, who are third.

World Road Championships
Venue: Melbourne Dates: 29 Sept - 3 Oct Coverage: Live on BBC Red Button & online on 29 Sep (0600-0750), 30 Sep (0400-0835), 2 Oct (0400-0735, 2240-0610 - 3 Oct), 3 Oct (Highlights 1300-1400)
Cancellera takes fourth world crown
Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara beat Britain's David Millar to clinch a record fourth time trial title at the Road World Championships.
Cancellara charged through the 45.8km circuit in 58 minutes, 9.19 seconds to beat Millar by one minute, 2.75secs.
Germany's Tony Martin was third in Australia in a time of 59mins 21secs.
Cancellara, 29, previously won the time trial at the championships in 2006 and 2007 before also triumphing in 2009 in his native Switzerland.
Prior to the race, he had shared the record for victories with Australian Michael Rogers.
The 2003, 2004 and 2005 winner was an early pacesetter he was pushed down to fifth, behind countryman Richie Porte, who missed out on the bronze medal by only seven seconds.
Cancellara, who won gold and bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the time trial and road race, had been a doubt to compete in Melbourne after pulling out of September's Tour of Spain because of fatigue.

Cancellara is awesome. Great ride by Millar though
SteelTownCobra
He said he would only take part at the World Championships if he was ""at 100%"" of his ability and his victory in overcast, occasionally gusty conditions in the city port of Geelong - his third win in six time trials this year - vindicated his stance.
""I'm really happy to have done this a fourth time,"" said Cancellara, who had one nervous moment when he appeared to clip a barrier midway through his run. ""It's maybe the hardest of all my wins because leading up to this I wasn't sure of my condition.
""The other guys went really well but I just tried to do what I can. I think today I employed the perfect tactic.
""People always think Cancellara is always going to win but that is not always true.
""I had to find another motivation, the motivation was to make history and that is what helped me stay focused. Even if a rider is always winning, he can still have bad days.
""I want to enjoy this. Tomorrow morning when I wake up, then it's another day.""
The performance by 33-year-old Millar continued Britain's positive start to the World Championships after Emma Pooley became the first British woman to win gold in the time trial 24 hours earlier.

Fourth world time-trial title 'amazing' - Cancellera
Millar, who secured the silver medal in 2001 and won the 2003 title only to be stripped of it after admitting to doping, was fastest out of the blocks, leading the field over the first two time checks, but could not match Cancellara when he hit his stride.
""Congratulations to Fabian, there is no doubt that he is a phenomenon,"" stated the Scot. ""I came here to get on the podium and I achieved it.
""I am very happy with my ride. My power was good, but I need to be faster and corner faster to beat Fabian.""
Martin, who was third in last year's World Championships, was one of seven riders in the race from United States-based ProTour team HTC Columbia and was attempting to win his fifth time trial of the year after victories in the Tour of California, the Tour de Suisse, the Eneco Tour and the German championship.
He started out as Cancellara's biggest challenger, but lost valuable time waiting for a change of tyre after puncturing his front wheel during the race.
""It is hard to keep your motivation when you have a flat tyre because you know that it can be over but I saw Gustav Larsson still ahead of me and still continued to fight,"" added Martin.
US rider David Zabriskie, who was second in 2006 and third in 2008, finished eighth and Swede Larsson, who won time trials in the Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a Madrid, Tour du Limousin and Swedish national championship, was 10th.

5;"Scotland call on Craig Gordon and Gary Caldwell
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
Levein wants Scots hard to beat
Craig Gordon and Gary Caldwell have been recalled after injury to a Scotland squad that, as expected, has no place for striker Kris Boyd.
QPR striker Jamie Mackie is confirmed as having his first call-up for the Scots in place of Middlesbrough's Boyd.
Celtic winger Shaun Maloney also returns to Craig Levein's squad.
But Caldwell looks likely to feature in only one of the Euro 2012 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Spain as part of an agreement with his club.
The defender has only played reserve football so far this season after having two hip operations during the summer.
And Wigan manager Roberto Martinez told BBC Sport: ""We have a very good relationship with the Scotland camp. I think they know exactly where Gary is.
They know Gary can't be available for the two games but is capable of performing in one of the games
Wigan manager Roberto Martinez
""The two medical departments have been in contact and I am quite happy for Scotland to call Gary up and use his experience and leadership.
""And, physically, they know he can't be available for the two games but is capable of performing in one of the games.
""From our point of view, it would speed his rehabilitation period for Gary and get him closer to full fitness for the demands for the Barclays Premier League.
""And, mentally, it will be a great reward for Gary has been working as an example of the way you should be working behind the scenes and he deserves that call-up.
""The demands of international football are different from the demands of the Barclays Premier League and, at the moment, Gary is ready to play 45 minutes of international football if Craig Levein thinks that's what he wants.""
Gordon is included ahead of Cardiff City's David Marshall despite Scotland's first-choice goalkeeper having yet to make a first-team appearance since recovering from a broken arm.
606: DEBATE
If all of the squad chosen today are fit I would pick; McGregor, Hutton, Weir, McManus, Whittaker, Maloney, Brown, McCulloch, Fletcher, Naismith and Miller.
I_am_a_blue_nose
And Sunderland manager Steve Bruce said: ""If I am being brutally honest, it is still a bit early and I wouldn't expect him to play for Scotland in them games considering he has had just one reserve game, trained for a week and been out for three months.""
But Levein stressed: ""I believe that he is some way towards full fitness and I feel it is important to get him back in the squad again.
""But I am really happy with Allan McGregor. I won't make any secret of it - Allan will be the starting keeper provided everything goes well between now and the first match.
""Gary is fit to play. Whether he is fully match fit is a different question and whether he is fit to play 90 minutes is another question.
""Gary is a really important player to me and the national team.
""Not only is he a good player, but he is a great leader and a good guy to have around the rest of the squad.
""I had a chat with his manager, Rob Martinez, and we are not going to do anything to jeopardise the lad.
""But he has been back in training and played a part in two reserve games, so he is not just back in the squad to gee people up, he is someone I will consider using if I think it is appropriate.""
However, there is no place for Middlesbrough's Kevin Thomson despite the midfielder being ahead of schedule as he returns from a leg break.
Thomson's team-mate, Boyd, had already been told by Levein that he should concentrate on returning to goalscoring form after his summer switch from Rangers to the Championship club.
His place goes to 24-year-old English-born Mackie, who has been in fine form as Queens Park Rangers continue to lead the same division, while Birmingham's James McFadden misses out through injury.
Levein admitted that Boyd, who had previously withdrawn his services after being left out by previous manager George Burley, was unhappy at being dropped.
However, he said: ""If you look at the strikers I have picked, I have picked players on form, that is basically it.
""I have had a chat with Kris and explained that to him.
""He is a top goalscorer and I have no doubt that, once he hits a bit of form, he will be back involved in the squad.""
Lee McCulloch is included in the squad but is suspended for the first game against Czech Republic on 8 October.
So Caldwell could be an option for a holding role in midfield in Prague in the absence of injured Aberdeen veteran Paul Hartley and the Rangers player, who will be available for the match at Hampden four days later.
Scotland squad
Goalkeepers: McGregor (Rangers), Gilks (Blackpool), Gordon (Sunderland)
Defenders: Hutton (Tottenham), Berra (Wolves), Broadfoot (Rangers), McManus (Middlesbrough), G Caldwell (Wigan), Weir (Rangers), Whittaker (Rangers)
Midfielders: Adam (Blackpool), Brown (Celtic), Dorrans (West Brom), McCulloch (Rangers), Fletcher (Manchester United), Morrison (West Brom), Robson (Middlesbrough), McEveley (Barnsley), Maloney (Celtic)
Forwards: Fletcher (Wolves), Iwelumo (Burnley), Mackie (QPR), Miller (Rangers), Naismith (Rangers).

6;"Dundee are to go into administration for the second time this decade
By Jim Spence
Dundee are to go into administration for the second time in seven years after failing to negotiate a deal over an outstanding tax bill of £365,000.
PKF has confirmed that the accountancy company has been appointed as administrator for the First Division football club.
The formal process is likely to take place on Wednesday or Thursday.
Redundancies are certain to follow and the club could receive a punitive points deduction.
""The directors of Dundee FC have today decided that their only option is to place the club into administration,"" said the club in a statement.
Until the administration is effective, all staff will remain in post and the club will continue to operate normally
Dundee Football Club statement
""The administration appointment is expected to take effect from the middle of next week and the directors have approached Bryan Jackson, of accountants PKF, to consider being appointed administrator.
""The directors have taken this decision with considerable regret but believe that they have no other choice in the current circumstances.
""Until the administration is effective, all staff will remain in post and the club will continue to operate normally.""
Players and staff received half wages on Wednesday after a delay in payment and it has now emerged that debts could be as high as £1.5m, although much of that appears to be to current directors.
And assistant manager Billy Dodds told BBC Scotland: ""As a management team, players and other staff, we are all in the dark.
""It has been tiring and there has to be some conclusion. If it helps save the club, so be it, but it does not deflect from how hard it is going to be for everybody at the club.""
The Dens Park club had hoped to make a one-off payment to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and arrange a settlement plan for the remaining debt.
Investor Calum Melville had pledged to fund such a move and his spokesman told BBC Scotland on Wednesday that the businessman had lodged £200,000 with the club's solicitors to aid the talks with the tax authorities and help with the payment of wages.
However, with Melville, the club's main benefactor, recently offering to resign his position from the board and ongoing concerns over mounting debts, the club has decided to move into administration in an attempt to secure their future.

9;"St Helens 10-22 Wigan Warriors
St Helens (6) 10
Tries: Dixon, Meli Goals: Foster
Wigan (16) 22
Tries: Gleeson 2, Goulding, S Tomkins Goals: Richards 2, Riddell
Martin Gleeson evades Paul Wellens to touch down at Old Trafford
By Ged Scott
BBC Sport at Old Trafford
Wigan pulled off their first Grand Final victory in 12 years by beating neighbours St Helens to ruin Keiron Cunningham's farewell at Old Trafford.
An early blitz of tries from Martin Gleeson (2) and Darrell Goulding put Michael Maguire's side 16-0 up.
And, although Andrew Dixon pulled one back for Saints before the break, Sam Tomkins' early second-half try sealed a deserved win for Wigan.
Francis Meli's late try could not spare Saints' fourth straight Final defeat.
Wigan had lost on their last two visits to Old Trafford, against St Helens in 2000 and Bradford in 2003.
But, having been acclaimed as the best side all season in lifting the League Leaders' Shield, this time they added the Grand Final to go with it in front of a record 71,526 crowd to be crowned Super League champions for the first time since beating Leeds 10-4 on the same ground in 1998.

Maguire praises 'special' players
And they defied the late first-half loss of injured record-breaking points machine Pat Richards in doing it.
Without the injured Kyle Eastmond, as expected, Matty Smith took over at scrum-half for Saints, with Jon Wilkin at stand-off.
But coach Mick Potter sprang a slight surprise by switching Sia Soliola to the pack, freeing him to recall fit-again Jonny Lomax on the wing and slip Meli inside to centre.
Wigan coach Michael Maguire resisted any temptation to include fit-again Amos Roberts, while leaving Mark Riddell on the bench.
There was a minute's silence before the game for former Wigan and Great Britain forward Terry Newton - not as respectfully observed as it might have been by a near capacity crowd.
But it did not take long for the mood to brighten for the Warriors fans - with the game's first try inside three minutes.
606: DEBATE
I'm sure there won't be many people out there who would dispute that Wigan deserved to win tonight after such a great season
UKMaverick
Soliola's misplaced pass lost possession deep inside his own half - setting up an attacking platform down the right - and Gleeson was on the end of it to power over in the right corner, Richards missing with the touchline conversion.
The first quarter of an hour had belonged to the league leaders and they made that dominance tell with a brilliant second try on 16 minutes.
Fed by Thomas Leuluai, Tomkins' stunning burst made it and, with Leuluai involved for a second time, it was Paul Deacon who slipped in Gleeson to gallop clear under the posts for his second try of the night and his 15th of the campaign.
Richards converted that one and, just four minutes later, Wigan were in again when Jon Wilkin spilled Tomkins' bomb to allow Darrell Goulding in at the corner for his 28th try of the season.
Wigan's domination was almost embarrassing, but Saints had to respond.
Spurred on by a couple of inspiring runs from Matty Smith, they finally found a foothold in the game and Goulding was forced to come up with a great cover tackle to force the marauding Meli into touch.
But Saints forced a breakthrough 12 minutes before the break when Wilkin timed his pass just right for replacement forward Andrew Dixon to burst through close to the posts, Jamie Foster adding the extras.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
No excuse for defeat - Potter
And there was worse news to follow for Wigan when this season's Man of Steel Richards limped down the tunnel five minutes before half time.
The Australian's absence proved a handicap when, with Leuluai having been denied a try with the first attack of the second half, only to be awarded a penalty, Wigan's replacement kicker Riddell missed from routine Richards range.
Wigan made up for it on 53 minutes when their star man Tomkins stole in for a superb solo try, resisting the challenges of three men and snaking out an arm to stretch his side three scores clear again.
Riddell again missed the kick but he made no mistake four minutes later when given another chance by referee Richard Silverwood with a penalty from in front of the posts to stretch Wigan's lead to 22-6.
Wigan thought they had sealed victory when Liam Farrell found a way through 20 minutes into the second half, only for it to be chalked off for obstruction by the video referee. And, with Riddell having gone off, Tomkins then made it four missed kicks on the night with another penalty opportunity.
That left Saints still just about within touching distance, especially when they ran in a second try with seven minutes left to move within two scores.
Smith's long pass let in Meli, lucky to still be on the pitch after a high challenge, to cross in the left corner. But it was far too little, far too late.

10;"In addition to the ban from the UK Anti-Doping Agency, Mr Newton was sacked by his club Wakefield when he tested positive for the banned substance in February.
At the time of his death he was running a pub with his father.
'Didn't do enough'
During his career played for Leeds, Wigan, his home town club, and Bradford. He represented Great Britain 15 times, scoring three tries, and also won five England caps.
A few days after his death outgoing Wakefield captain Jason Demetriou criticised how the Rugby Football League dealt with his case.
He told BBC Leeds: ""The RFL offer counselling but it doesn't go far enough.
""I don't really know what the RFL offered Terry, but the word coming out sounds like they didn't do enough.""
The inquest was formally adjourned and a provisional date of 20 December was set for the hearing to reopen.
The RFL described his death as a ""great tragedy"" but said ""every registered rugby league player has access to counselling services if they want them and that Mr Newton ""will have been reminded of that counselling service"".

11;"US Grand Prix organisers insist 2012 race is not in doubt
The layout for Austin's US Grand Prix circuit includes more than 20 corners
Organisers of the United States Grand Prix at a new site in Austin, Texas insist the race will go ahead in 2012.
Rumours surfaced in the paddock during last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix that the event was already in doubt.
But Formula 1 United States spokesman Adam Goldman told BBC Sport:""Tremendous progress is being made on the circuit in Austin, Texas.
""The project team and community look forward to hosting the F1 United States Grand Prix in 2012.""
BBC pundit Martin Brundle raised the issue during the Formula 1 forum after Sunday's race in Singapore, amid rumours the local authorities had not been properly consulted over the plans and with fears over road links to the site which is expected to attract 120,000 fans.
But Goldman insisted all the relevant bodies are on board and work is due to start in December.
""We are working with the State of Texas, City of Austin and Travis County to break ground on the project by the end of the year,"" he said.
Local media reports in Austin suggested it would need £9.5m ($15m) of road improvements to guarantee clearing people from the site within three hours and there is a feeling it is unlikely this can be completed in time for the race in 2012.
606: DEBATE
I know we've had several discussions about how bad those Tilke-tracks are, but I would like to take a different approach and try to understand what is the reason for it.
Kai FT
But after a delegation visited this year's British Grand Prix at Silverstone, which had a history of transport problems until road improvements were carried out, the organisers have brought in a number of specialists to look at traffic management, including Graham Lake-Grange, a former member of the Silverstone circuit senior management team.
Joe Gieselman, manager of Travis County's Transportation and Natural Resources Department, said: ""Local officials are concerned that the two-lane roads to the selected F1 site in Austin do not have the capacity to serve a 120,000-person event, and that there are neither the funds nor sufficient time to make approach road improvements prior to the first race in 2012.
""In response, the Austin F1 sponsor hired Kimley-Horn & Associates, who prepared a transportation plan for the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, and Graham Lake-Granges, director of Valleta Events Solutions, the English firm that analysed the traffic at UK's Silverstone's track, to look at the Austin site.
""Austin officials will work with these firms to find solutions to potential traffic problems.""
The 3.4-mile Hermann Tilke-designed circuit will cost an estimated £115m ($180m) to build with the Formula 1 event expected to generate £190m ($300m) for the local economy each year, as well as job opportunities.
Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone agreed a deal for the Texas capital to host a race until 2021 and, for the first time, a venue for the US Grand Prix will be purpose-built.
The last US Grand Prix took place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana in 2007, a race won by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton.
Its eight-year run was ended after Ecclestone failed to come to an agreement with the circuit's chiefs over new terms.
Watkins Glen in upstate New York, Long Beach, California, Las Vegas, Detroit, Dallas and Phoenix have all hosted F1 races in the past.

Replay - Workforce wins 2010 Derby
PRIX DE l'ARC DE TRIOMPHE
Date: Sunday 3 October, 1505 BST Racecourse: Longchamp, Paris
Coverage: Live on BBC Two and BBC Sport website 1400-1525
Commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live
Sir Michael Stoute-trained Workforce has been cleared to run in Sunday's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.
The colt, ridden by Ryan Moore, was an easy winner of the Derby but was well beaten by Harbinger in the King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.
Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for owner Khalid Abdullah, confirmed that ""Workforce will run"".
The decision to send Workforce was made after an encouraging piece of routine work on Thursday morning at Newmarket.
""The main thing was to see his action and his general demeanour, and both were good,"" said Grimthorpe.
""He just had a nice smooth piece of work about four and a half furlongs for a blow-out. He had a normal blow and moved well.""
Workforce, who is rated around a 5-1 second favourite for the mile-and-a-half contest at Longchamp, went as high as 18s on betting exchanges on Wednesday as speculation about his participation mounted.
""I was mystified when the horse's price went out the other day (on the exchanges). Someone has a few pounds on and the whole thing goes weird,"" added Grimthorpe.
""The whole point of waiting until the last moment is because he really is an important horse to us.
""We didn't want to mess people around and they knew from the beginning if they were betting on the horse well in advance then there was a good deal of risk involved.""
The three-year-old also completed a satisfactory gallop at Sandown on 21 September.
The 2010 Derby winner has only run four times in his career, and suffered his second defeat when fifth to Harbinger on 24 July.
606: DEBATE
Who do you think will win the Arc?
In Sunday's big race, ante-post favourite Behkabad will be ridden by Christophe Lemaire, who has elected to partner Jean-Claude Roget's stable star in preference to the Aga Khan's second runner, Sarafina.
Behkabad, like 2009 winner Sea the Stars, is a son of Cape Cross and has just headed fellow French-trained colt Planteur on his last two runs, both at Longchamp.
Three-year-old Behkabad, has form on testing ground so should not be inconvenienced by the forecast for wet weather around Paris in the build-up to the big race.
Gerald Mosse will be on board French Oaks winner Sarafina.
Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien has voiced his concerns about the possibility of heavy going for his pair Fame and Glory and Cape Blanco.
But there was an upbeat bulletin from trainer Mick Channon about his triple Arc runner-up Youmzain.
""He's in great heart and is the Arc's yardstick. I'm as confident as ever that he'll run another massive race,"" said the former Southampton and England footballer.
Meanwhile, Kieren Fallon, who won the Arc on Hurricane Run in 2005 and Dylan Thomas in 2007, has been snapped up to ride the French outsider Timos.

13;"Commonwealth Games 2010: boxer Khalid Yafai withdraws
Flyweight Yafai, 21, boxed for Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing
England boxing gold medal hope Khalid Yafai has become the latest big-name athlete to withdraw from the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.
The 21-year-old from Birmingham, who would have started as favourite in the 52kg flyweight division, has pulled out due to a long-standing elbow injury.
Announcing the news on Facebook, Yafai said he was ""gutted"".
The decision means three-time ABA champion Tommy Stubbs will now compete for England in the flyweight category.
The absence of the European silver medallist will be a blow to the England boxing team's medal haul ambitions.
They claimed five gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne four years ago.
Other squad members include the two other British boxers who secured silver medals at the European Amateur Boxing Championship in Moscow in June, Bournemouth's Iain Weaver and Tom Stalker from Liverpool.
Liverpool's Stubbs moves up from the 48kg division to box at the higher weight in Delhi.
""Khalid had an operation on his elbow following the European Championships in July,"" said head coach, Rob McCracken.
""Despite the progress he has made, we have decided it would not be in our long-term interests to risk him at this tournament, so have made the decision to bring in Tommy Stubbs at flyweight.
""Tommy is our number two at the weight and I am confident he will acquit himself well.""
McCracken added: ""Khalid needs to rest the injury and give it more time to recover from the operation so that he is fully fit for the Olympic qualifying competitions in 2011.""
Australian discus thrower Scott Martin and sprint hurdler Hayley Butler have also pulled out of the Commonwealth Games because of injury.
""It is very unfortunate and has nothing to do with security concerns. Both pulled out due to injuries,"" a team spokesman said in Delhi.
""Scott had an injury to his pectoral muscle while Hayley suffered a calf muscle injury.""
Neither athlete travelled with the Australian team that touched down in the Indian capital on Wednesday.
Martin won the discus gold at the 2006 Games in Melbourne, where he also clinched a bronze medal in the shot put.

I try to take another step but it is so humid that it feels like the air is resisting me. The camera is faring no better, the lens has steamed up and cannot see a thing.
I'm in a special environmental chamber where they can recreate the heat, humidity and altitude of almost any location in the world. Today the chamber is set to 30 degrees Celsius and 85% humidity to mirror conditions in Delhi where the Commonwealth Games are due to start.
I can't imagine doing anything in these conditions let alone cycling and lifting weights for an hour but that is exactly what the England women's hockey team are here to do.
They have recently returned from the World Cup in Argentina, where they took bronze and need to acclimatise quickly to the conditions in Delhi.
This environmental chamber at the English Institute of Sport's (EIS) high performance centre at Bisham Abbey is the largest non-military chamber in the UK but is still no larger than the temporary buildings you would find on a building site.

There are three hour-long sessions in which the athletes are split into two groups. Half of the group go through a ""robustness"" session which involves waddling around the chamber with a heavy load across the shoulders.
It's not the most elegant sight but they're strengthening the soft tissue around the hip and lower back - the part of the body that hockey taxes the most.
The other half are on the bikes and for 30 minutes they alternate between a minute's worth of high intensity cycling and a minute's rest.
Andy Hudson, EIS's strength and conditioning coach, explains that this is a chance for the athletes' bodies to get used to the Indian climate.
""What we're trying to do through this acclimation process is give them the opportunity to experience the elevated heart rate and blood flow that comes hand in hand with the increased heat and pressure and give them an opportunity internally to adapt to the hot environment.""
England are keen to improve on the bronze medal they secured in last month's World Cup and are looking to exploit any advantage they can find.
Mentally, it's making them able to understand what kind of pressures they might be under
Tom Cross, performance pyschologist
""It's uncomfortable to do high intensity exercise in this sort of environment and therefore just doing it more frequently ahead of travelling gives them an opportunity to get slightly ahead of the curve,"" he adds.
It's clear that although the session is designed to maintain the athletes physically, it is as much to do with preparing the team mentally for the conditions that await them.
Athletes often struggle in unfamiliar surroundings because their thoughts interfere with their performance. But this session is part of England's psychological training, which includes visualisation and cognitive behavioural therapy.
Tom Cross, EIS's performance psychologist, explains; ""Mentally, it's making them able to understand what kind of pressures they might be under and how they can keep their thoughts and minds focused on what they need to be focused on, which is playing hockey"".
In elite competition, they say you need a physiotherapist for your body and a psychologist for your mind.
England's hockey team have both and should be prepared to in peak physical and mental condition as they touch down in Delhi.

The revelation that Alberto Contador , the three-time winner of the Tour de France , tested positive for a banned substance during this year’s race has sent cycling reeling into yet another doping scandal just as the sport’s reputation appeared to be on the mend.

Alberto Contador won his third Tour de France after a positive drug test on the final rest day.
The best cyclist of his generation, Contador is the sport’s latest star to test positive for a prohibited substance. If the positive result is upheld, he faces a two-year suspension from competition.
Contador insists, however, that his failed drug test for clenbuterol, a banned weight-loss and muscle-building drug, is a huge mistake. At a news conference in Spain on Thursday, he said that he did not knowingly use the drug and that he believed the positive urine sample was a result of his consuming contaminated beef that a friend had brought from Spain for him and his Astana teammates.
“I’m the victim,” a visibly emotional Contador said at the news conference in Pinto, his hometown, on the outskirts of Madrid. “I’m sad, disappointed, but am keeping my head held high,” he said. “It’s a clear case of food contamination. I won’t tolerate any sanction.”
Though cycling has one of the strictest, most thorough antidoping programs in all of sports, its credibility has come into question yet again. Excluding Carlos Sastre, who won in 2008, every Tour winner dating to 1996 has either tested positive, confessed to doping or been at the center of a doping scandal. Currently, there is a federal investigation into suspected doping on the United States Postal Service team that starred the seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong .
Contador tested positive for a “very small concentration” of the drug on the final rest day of the Tour, according to the International Cycling Union . He was not told of the results until Aug. 24, nearly one month after he beat out the second-place finisher, Andy Schleck of Luxembourg, by 39 seconds.
Since then, Contador has hired a team of experts to help prove his food-contamination case, but it may take months, if not years, to get a final ruling. A Dutch scientist hired by Contador, Douwe de Boer, has already generated a paper concluding that “it is extremely likely and would be only fair” to say that the existence of clenbuterol in Contador’s system was from an accidental ingestion of contaminated meat.
An expert in clenbuterol contamination in meat, however, characterized Contador’s explanation as almost impossible.
The only other rider to lose the Tour title because of doping was Floyd Landis , who tested positive for synthetic testosterone three days after winning in 2006. Fourteen months later, after a public and heated legal fight with antidoping authorities, he was stripped of the Tour title.
Contador’s case will not be simple, antidoping experts say.
Pat McQuaid, the cycling union’s president, did not return phone calls or e-mails, but the union said in a statement that Contador’s case “required further scientific investigation before any conclusion could be drawn.”
The case is complex because it is possible that Contador did ingest the drug by accident.
Clenbuterol has been found in meat before — pork contaminated with the drug caused 70 people to become ill in China last year. Still, even a trace amount of the substance in an athlete’s urine — no matter how it got there — triggers a positive test.
“There are a couple of substances that have a threshold amount, but this is not one of them,” David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency , said by telephone from India, where he is attending the Commonwealth Games. “A case must be pursued if it’s found in an athlete’s system.”
The American swimmer Jessica Hardy missed the 2008 Olympics after testing positive for the same drug; she said she had taken a contaminated nutritional supplement. An arbitration panel ruled that her claim was true, but only reduced her two-year ban to one year.
Howard Jacobs, Hardy’s lawyer, said that an athlete who ingests a contaminated nutritional supplement must receive a sanction under antidoping rules, but that one who ingests a contaminated food product, like meat, has a chance of receiving no sanction at all.
“If Contador proves that it came from contaminated meat, I think he would be a good candidate for a no-fault finding, which would mean no penalty,” Jacobs said. “With supplements, you’re supposed to know what’s in them. But if it’s in beef, no one would expect that the steak they are eating would cause a positive test of clenbuterol.”
Even if Contador proves the meat was contaminated — challenging in itself because the meat cannot be tested — Jacobs said there would be a question of what would happen with his Tour results. Even in a no-fault finding, competition results from that day are usually nullified. But Contador tested positive on a rest day, with no competition.
“It’s kind of a peculiar situation,” Jacobs said. “From the legal side, there are some interesting issues.”

Danilo Gallinari, 22, is a rising star for the Knicks and a minor celebrity in Italy. More Photos ¬ª
The rim looks a little higher than 10 feet. The court has no lines, only a green zigzag of moss squeezed between interlocking gray and red bricks. An errant shot might end up in the tall wild grass behind the metal stanchion.
This was Danilo Gallinari’s court, and his place of solitude, where he could practice Michael Jordan ’s moves and act out sequences he had memorized from the countless N.B.A. videos that lined his shelves.
“Just the basket, me and the ball,” Gallinari said recently.
This is where a spindly Italian boy — born into a farming family, the son of a modestly skilled professional player — fed his obsession and began crafting the jump shot that is now one of the smoothest in the N.B.A.
Gallinari was 5 years old when his father, Vittorio, installed the basket on the brick driveway outside their home. At the time, it was the only basket within 20 miles. Gallinari found his rhythm with a two-handed push-up shot. At age 6, he won a street-fair shooting contest, beating a bunch of men in their 20s and 30s.
At 11, he was making 55 percent of his 3-point shots.
At 14, he went away to live at a basketball academy in Casalpusterlengo, 17 miles from home.
At 16, he was so easily beating his father in one-on-one games that Vittorio retired for good.
At 18, he was starring for Armani Jeans Milano, his father’s old team.
Now Gallinari is 22, a rising star for the Knicks and a minor celebrity in his country. His career will come full circle on Sunday, when the Knicks play an exhibition game against Milano at the Mediolanum Forum. The game sold out last spring in a matter of hours. Gallinari heard there were 85,000 ticket requests for an arena that seats 12,000.
“I hope I don’t get too emotional,” Gallinari said in a recent interview at Eataly, a sprawling new Italian market in New York’s Flatiron District.
As he strolled through the aisles of pasta and olive oil, Gallinari stopped occasionally to shake hands with well-wishing Knick fans. He is actually recognized more often on the streets of Manhattan than in Milan, where soccer is a religion and basketball is a minor sport. Among basketball icons here, Gallinari would rank well behind his coach, Mike D’Antoni , who starred for Milano in the 1970s and ’80s, leading the club to numerous championships.
“Mike is an idol there,” Gallinari said. “He won everything.”
The perspective is different in Graffignana, a close-knit farming town of 2,000 people, about 40 kilometers southeast of Milan. The Gallinari family has lived here for generations, growing corn and wheat, and raising pigs, cows and chickens. Gallinari’s father worked on the farm before turning pro. There were still roosters roaming the homestead when Danilo was a boy, which makes his nickname, Gallo (Italian for rooster), seem all the more appropriate. Vittorio and Marilisa, his mother, still spend their summers here, with their younger son, 13-year-old Federico.
On the night in June 2008 when Danilo was drafted, nearly the entire village gathered in front of a video screen suspended in the downtown area to watch the proceedings. It was nearly 3 a.m. here when Commissioner David Stern called Gallinari’s name, as the sixth overall pick.
The Knicks drafted Gallinari, 19 at the time, for his height and athleticism and his splendid jump shot. He was Milano’s go-to scorer in fourth quarters, despite being the youngest player on a team stacked with American expatriates. He played with an edge and an air of pure confidence.
“He is mentally tough,” said Flavio Tranquillo, Italy’s top basketball broadcaster and a longtime family friend. “All of his toughness comes from his father.”
Vittorio Gallinari was known as an enforcer during his days as D’Antoni’s teammate with Olimpia Milano, as the team was previously known. He was not, however, much of a scorer.
“Probably the worst shooter ever to play the game,” Tranquillo said, only half-joking.
It quickly became evident that Danilo’s DNA was of a unique strain. During halftime of his father’s games, Gallinari would sometimes wander down to the court to shoot jumpers. The more he made, the more fans buzzed and pointed. It was too much attention for a bashful 6-year-old.
“He became shy and then he cried, ‘Mama, I want to go,’¬†” Vittorio, chuckling softly, recalled in an interview at his home. “At the end of the game, they’d just stay to see him shoot. They said, ‘If his father could score like him, we’d win much more games.’¬†”
When he wasn’t watching hours of N.B.A. tapes, Gallinari was on the brick court, spending hours on his shot, even at night.

But as golf’s longest prologue accelerated into its final phase at Celtic Manor this week, Colin Montgomerie was still visibly reveling in his role, brightening whenever he was addressed as Captain Montgomerie.
“That’s a very polite start; I hope your question resembles it,” he said to a reporter with mock gravity Monday.
Montgomerie, the bushy-haired 47-year-old Scot, has had other domains. He won the European Tour’s Order of Merit a record seven consecutive times in the 1990s. But the Ryder Cup has been his happiest hunting ground, the place where he could throw back his sometimes sagging shoulders, flash his toothiest grin, adopt his finest head-of-the-family manner and make everyone forget, for the duration of a few days, that he had never managed to win a major championship.
“If he’s anywhere near as good a Ryder Cup captain as he was a Ryder Cup player, he’ll be tough to beat,” said Tom Lehman , a former United States captain who is an assistant captain under Corey Pavin this year.
The Cup is not the house that Montgomerie built for Europe. That honor belongs to the Englishman Tony Jacklin and the Spanish swashbuckler Seve Ballesteros , who played the leading roles in rescuing the Cup from American domination.
But Monty, as he has been known since childhood, has certainly been an excellent caretaker. From 1995 through 2006, with Montgomerie at his peak, Europe won five of six Cups. The only loss came in 1999 in Brookline, Mass., when the Americans roared back on the final day with the help of boisterous fans, some of whom yelled unprintable things at Montgomerie and caused his father, James, to leave the course.
Montgomerie qualified for his first team in 1991, intent on playing for Europe to honor his mother, Betty, who had died of lung cancer earlier that year at age 53. One of the first moves he made as a team member was to mistakenly put on the golf shoes of the European star Nick Faldo . But he would soon find his footing and his putting stroke, something that has proved more difficult for him when playing for himself.
“I’ve always hit my putts slightly firmer in Ryder Cup play,” Montgomerie said, pointing out that his succession of top partners, including Bernhard Langer and Padraig Harrington , have allowed him the freedom to be aggressive.
In eight Cups, Montgomerie has won 23.5 points for Europe, 1.5 short of Faldo’s record. He is 8-3-3 in foursomes, 6-6-2 in four-ball sessions and — most proudly — unbeaten in singles, with six victories and two halves, which is golf vernacular for ties.
Would losing this Cup as captain tarnish all that in any way?
“Not at all, not at all,” Montgomerie said, setting up his next wisecrack. “I’ll still hold the record of not having lost a singles match.”
As in many sports, there is no guarantee that brilliant players will make brilliant leaders. See Faldo, who bombed as Europe’s captain and speechmaker in chief at the last Ryder Cup, in 2008 at the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., where he declined to use one of his wild-card picks on Montgomerie.
This seems the right time to reiterate that being a Ryder Cup captain is hardly the same psychological and tactical challenge as, say, coaching a national soccer team or even a college golf team, like the one that Montgomerie played on for four years at Houston Baptist University in the 1980s.
The Ryder Cup is, despite all the biennial hullabaloo, a mere three-day test in which the players are often just as experienced and savvy as their captain.
But there are  tough choices to be made. Montgomerie already had to leave Paul Casey, No. 7 in the world rankings this week, off his team, as well as Justin Rose. And the communications load can be heavy, which has never been much of a problem for Montgomerie. He is doubly expressive, with a face that reflects every inner doom cloud or sunbeam and with a voice that specializes in colorful paragraphs instead of monochrome sentences.
“It would be a bloody boring life if everyone was perfect, for God’s sake,” he once said. “We need personalities, and I suppose I’m seen as one of them.”
He is indeed. Endearing to some, intensely irritating to others, he is an uncommon, sour-and-sweet brew of impetuosity and intelligence, of huff and subtle humor, of self-importance and self-deprecation.
“Corey has not hit a golf shot for a month; I haven’t hit a golf shot for about two years,” he said this week, poking fun at his own poor playing record, which has seen him fall to 424th in the world rankings.
But then the contradictions go way back. How could someone so volcanic, someone capable of taking great offense at a lone heckler or camera click, have idolized the icy, hyperfocused Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg as a child instead of John McEnroe ?
The risk, of course, for a Ryder Cup captain is becoming a distraction, something that Montgomerie is perfectly capable of and has already flirted with by speaking openly about the consequences of Tiger Woods ’s personal problems. This seemed a strange move considering the stormy, expensive end to Montgomerie’s own first marriage as well as his more recent decision to reportedly seek an injunction from a British court in July to prevent a tabloid newspaper from publishing an article about his private life.
“I know a lot of you are having a lot of fun right now at my expense,” he told reporters at the P.G.A. Championship last month. “I apologize for this, that you have to bring this up, but at the same time no further comments from myself on that matter.”
Nor should there be further comments on the matter at Celtic Manor, where Montgomerie is well aware that he has a big opportunity to resume playing the Ryder Cup talisman after having had no part in the 2008 loss to the United States.
He had not initially planned to be the captain here. Though it has been a long-term goal, he focused — publicly at least — on taking the job for the 2014 Cup at Gleneagles in his native Scotland. But the manner of the lopsided defeat at Valhalla accelerated the timetable for Montgomerie and European tour officials and players whose circuit continues to depend heavily on Ryder Cup success and visibility.
“I’m honored, hugely honored,” Montgomerie said of his selection as the team captain. “But at the same time, I have a huge responsibility as well.”
Still, there is clearly more upside to being the captain who wins back the Ryder Cup than to being the captain who fails to retain it. Yet whatever happens on the rolling and probably soggy course at Celtic Manor, Montgomerie plans to abandon his golf cart and try to make the next team.
“Biggest event in my golfing career, and I’ve come here with no clubs,” Montgomerie said this week. “Quite weird, really.”

“It’s not a function of if he will break Jack’s records, it’s a matter of when,” Foley said. “Tiger is only 34. He’s got basically 12 more years and that’s 48 more majors to win four. I don’t know how many majors he will win, but it’s definitely more than 18.
“I’ll go with 22 or 23.”
Foley  was at a function in Manhattan announcing his new role as a regular contributor for Golf Digest.
“I find it amazing how quickly Tiger went from almost a messiah in the golf world to someone who people say is finished or done,” Foley said. “I know as a teacher I’m only teaching him things he’s already done before. It’s like working with Amadeus. We’re talking about a straight-up genius.
“You don’t teach him, you just stand there and answer his questions and make some adjustments.”
Foley, who is based in Orlando, Fla., lives only three miles from the Isleworth Golf and Country Club practice range where he works with Woods. Their sessions last about two hours a day. Woods has not played competitive golf since the BMW Championship ended Sept. 12. He did not qualify for the Tour Championship last weekend.
Foley, 36, conceded that when he first began working with Woods, the experience was surreal.
“I spent years cheering this guy from afar,” Foley said. “And now he’s standing next to me on the range asking me about his golf swing.”
But Foley, who also works with Hunter Mahan, Justin Rose, Stephen Ames and Sean O’Hair, said his rapport with Woods developed naturally.
“He’s a guy’s guy, and we talk about sports,” Foley said. “We’ve created this thing in our mind that says: ‘Oh, it’s Tiger. There he is.’ But he’s just a guy who happens to be a way better golfer than most everybody else.”
Foley also acknowledged that Woods’s game has been in a rut and that he has been playing differently than he had for most of his career. Foley, who was born near Toronto, compared Woods to Wayne Gretzky .
“Gretzky had off years,” he said. “Every athlete has them. I don’t know or care the catalyst, but it happens.”
Asked when Woods would rebound and return to form, Foley said: “Until he’s playing more than 10 tournament events in a year and he can prepare and do everything he wants to do golf-wise, there’s no discussion. Right now, we go over things that are necessary and talk about what matters. He sometimes tells me, ‘I don’t like that.’ Then we do something else. It’s a shared experience.”
In Foley, Woods will find a font of information. In a 40-minute conversation, he twice mentioned his hero Nelson Mandela , invoked lessons he learned from Copernicus and told stories of his days as a personal trainer. He laces his lessons with biomechanics and dynamic physics. When describing a swing, he uses phrases like angle of mobility and the point of linear force at the low part of the arc.
How does Woods absorb all the technicalities?
“Tiger obviously knows plenty about the golf swing,” Foley said, smiling. “You know, he’s got the territory down. But what impresses me most about him is his ability to keep the same focus for a very long time. Whatever we’re working on, he can hit that shot over and over and over again. It’s amazing to watch.”
But Foley is not just a theorist. He is a realist.
“Tiger sees the merit of what we’re working on,” he said. “But any player has to see the results. So that is what comes next.”

Travis Snider of the Toronto Blue Jays shows off his Cito Gaston mustache against the Yankees.
“I want to play,” said Mark Teixeira , dealing with a broken toe and an ailing thumb. “I want to win this division.”
Not even the Yankees’ varsity lineup could overcome a seven-run deficit — the team’s second of the series and fourth in seven games — in losing to the Blue Jays, 8-4 , in Toronto Manager Cito Gaston’s last game at Rogers Centre before he retires.
The Yankees’ consolation, such as it was on a night when their inability to capitalize on Tampa Bay ’s loss to Baltimore left them a half-game back in the East , was that their starting pitcher Wednesday may have thrown his last pitch in pinstripes.
That pitch landed in the second deck in left field , a three-run homer by Aaron Hill against Javier Vazquez , who allowed 7 runs and 10 hits in four and two-thirds innings. A week after hitting three consecutive batters, Vazquez allowed three home runs, and the cumulative damage is bound to compel the Yankees to look elsewhere for a long reliever in their playoff bullpen.
Afterward, Girardi was noncommittal, but Vazquez seemed resigned to his fate.
“If I would have thrown the ball better, obviously that would help my case,” said Vazquez, who has a 5.32 earned run average and is second in the A.L. with 32 homers allowed . He added, “Today was an important day for me personally, but it didn’t go well.”
For weeks, winning the division has been the Yankees’ public posture, even if Girardi repeatedly said that he prioritized health over the division title and home-field advantage. He said Tuesday that he had been planning to spread rest among Teixeira, Robinson Cano , Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez — especially with another game on the turf here — to put the Yankees in commanding position heading into the playoffs.
“They’re going to get Monday and Tuesday next week,” said Girardi, in explaining his change in plans, adding: “These guys know their bodies better than I do, that’s for sure. I talked to them, they feel good. When you’re trying to win the division, you want those guys in the lineup.”
Those guys had 4 of the team’s 11 hits Wednesday, including Rodriguez’s 30th homer of the season . But the Yankees still lost their ninth straight game against a left-handed starter. They scored three runs off Brett Cecil in the sixth, which only cut their deficit to 7-3.
The Yankees will not know their opponent — the Minnesota Twins or the Texas Rangers — for the best-of-five division series that begins next Wednesday until this weekend, when the A.L. East is resolved. If the Yankees win the division, they will play Texas at Yankee Stadium . If they capture the wild card, they will open at Minnesota.
The uncertainty is causing the Yankees’ scouts to work double time, and they will be holding exhaustive meetings by the end of the week to discuss both teams. Although the pitching coach Dave Eiland said recently that their opponent would not affect how the Yankees aligned their rotation after C. C. Sabathia , Girardi on Wednesday suggested otherwise. The Rangers’ lineup — with Nelson Cruz, Ian Kinsler, Vladimir Guerrero , Michael Young and Bengie Molina — is heavily right-handed, which could change how and when Phil Hughes and A. J. Burnett are used.
The Twins — with left-handed sluggers like Joe Mauer, Jim Thome and Jason Kubel — may prompt Girardi to stack his two left-handers, Sabathia and Andy Pettitte , in the first two games. Some managers prefer alternating left-handed and right-handed starters in the playoffs to give opponents a different look, but Girardi said he did not feel that way, perhaps because Sabathia and Pettitte are his two most reliable and playoff-tested starters.
In setting the rotation for this weekend, Girardi gave himself options for the division series, although he declined to announce who would pitch after Sabathia. Pettitte will go Friday night in Boston, and he will be followed Saturday by Burnett. Either could work Game 2 on healthy rest, as could Hughes, theoretically, who is scheduled to pitch at some point this weekend.
Girardi said that Hughes, at 175 1/3 innings, would be permitted to make another regular-season appearance, and acknowledged the possibility of his starting Sunday. Depending on where the division race stands, the Yankees may divide the innings in Sunday’s game among some playoff-bound relievers.
Despite his ghastly start Monday and a 6.67 E.R.A. in his last 21 starts , Burnett remains in consideration for a postseason start, even though the Yankees, who could pitch Sabathia on short rest in Game 4, do not necessarily need him. Entertaining thoughts of a three-man playoff rotation is not what the Yankees had in mind last winter when they acquired Vazquez from Atlanta.
“Not a good year for me personally,” Vazquez said, “but hopefully as a team we’ll have a better year.”

Justin Morneau sustained his concussion on July 7, when Blue Jays second baseman John McDonald accidentally kneed him.
But to almost everyone, except his teammates, Morneau sightings have been very limited. He sits in the dugout during home games. He appeared on the field briefly last Tuesday night to celebrate after the Twins clinched the American League Central division title. Lately, that has been about it.
In managing Morneau’s recovery, the Twins stopped giving daily medical updates, Smith said, to discourage speculation about his progress or setbacks. They also shield him from members of the news media. Morneau last spoke to reporters on Sept. 8, when the Twins nominated him for Major League Baseball’s Roberto Clemente Award for community service. That day, a glassy-eyed Morneau said he was still symptomatic but remained hopeful he might return before the end of the season.
Doctors treating Morneau are confident he will resume his career, Smith said. But no one knows exactly when that will be. The Twins appear to be proceeding as if Morneau will not be available when the playoffs begin next week, perhaps against the Yankees .
“If he was ready, he would be out on the field hitting with us,” Gardenhire said last week. However, on Wednesday, before the Twins beat the Royals , 4-2, in Kansas City, Gardenhire offered a glimmer of hope, telling reporters that Morneau would work out with the Twins on Thursday, when they return to Target Field for a season-ending series with Toronto.
But Gardenhire would not speculate whether Morneau could play at some point in the postseason.
Smith and Gardenhire both say they no longer ask Morneau how he’s feeling. Both seem intent on not pressuring him into coming back too soon. Still, if Morneau does work out with the team Thursday, the question of how he feels will be front and center. The importance of being cautious will undoubtedly have to be re-emphasized.
“Every one of us would love to have Justin Morneau in the lineup tonight,” Smith said last week. “But we’re not going to jeopardize Justin Morneau’s long-term health or his long-term career. If we have to wait two days or two weeks, we wait two days or two weeks. If we have to wait six months, we wait six months.”
Among the major leaguers who sustained concussions this season — a list that includes St. Louis Cardinals catcher Jason LaRue, who has decided to retire, and Jason Bay of the Mets — Morneau is the biggest name. The 2006 A.L. most valuable player, Morneau was in the midst of another successful season (.345, 18 homers, 56 runs batted in) when he was accidentally kneed in the head by Toronto’s John McDonald on a takeout slide into second base on July 7.
The Twins pulled Morneau out of the game immediately. He did not play the next day and accompanied the Twins to Detroit to be examined by Dr. Kenneth Podell, a neuropsychology consultant for the Detroit Lions and Red Wings . Podell sent him back to Minneapolis to rest.
Smith said the Twins’ medical and training staffs took a greater interest in concussions after the plight of Corey Koskie, a longtime Twin who missed two and a half seasons with post-concussion syndrome, for an injury sustained with the Milwaukee Brewers , before retiring in March 2009. Koskie called Smith shortly after Morneau was examined and later talked to Morneau.
The Twins already knew to be careful with Morneau, who had previously told the medical staff he sustained four head injuries playing basketball and hockey as a youngster. As a Twin, he missed 10 days with a concussion after a 2005 beaning.
At first, Morneau said his symptoms were not as severe as in 2005. But they did not subside as quickly. He took batting practice on the field on Aug. 7, and there was talk he might soon begin a rehabilitation assignment. That did not happen. In late August, Morneau was told to cease baseball activities and concentrate on cardiovascular work at home. He quietly resumed hitting several weeks ago.
Dr. Christopher Giza, an associate professor of pediatric neurology and neurosurgery at U.C.L.A. , said the Twins had followed established guidelines in their treatment of Morneau. He said some patients with a history of head injuries did not recover quickly from another incident even if the initial symptoms, as in Morneau’s case, did not seem that severe.
In an interview on Sept. 8, Morneau expressed frustration over sitting out for a second consecutive season. Last year, Morneau did not play after Sept. 12 because of a cracked bone in his lower back. The Twins won the A.L. Central but were swept by the Yankees in the playoffs.
This season the Morneau-less Twins have compiled a 47-23 record in the second half. Among the keys to the surge have been a career season from left fielder Delmon Young (110 R.B.I.), unexpected production from the 40-year-old designated hitter Jim Thome (25 homers and a .280 average) and a .383 second half from Joe Mauer .
“It seems like they play pretty good without him,” White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle said of Morneau. “That’s the type of team they have. When one of their superstars goes down, even a great hitter like he is and defensive guy at first base, it seems like they have somebody to step right on in.”
In the September interview, Morneau lamented his ongoing absence, saying, “You never know how many chances you’re going to get to win.”
Michael Cuddyer, who missed more than two and a half months in 2008 with finger and foot injuries, said he understood Morneau’s frustration but could not offer him much comfort. “Automatically, if you’re not on the field, you’re going to feel like that,” said Cuddyer, who replaced Morneau at first base. “So you have to do stuff to make yourself feel like a part of it.”
Morneau tries. On Sept. 17, when center fielder Denard Span reported a jammed shoulder, Morneau gave the minor league callup Ben Revere advance notice that he would be making his first major league start. Last Tuesday night, Morneau sprayed Champagne with teammates after the Twins clinched and carefully hugged the much smaller Span on the field. But he turned his head to avoid an accidental bump.
Meanwhile, Gardenhire said he could not help but think how much more formidable the Twins would be with his phantom in the lineup.
“I just wish I had my first baseman,” he said.

Simmons, left, led the N.F.L. with 19 sacks in 1992. He also played for the Cardinals, Jaguars, Bengals and Bears.
Sixteen years ago, Buddy Ryan hired a 31-year-old defensive line coach with enormous enthusiasm but no N.F.L. experience. Ryan figured his new coach, his son Rex, would benefit from the presence of a veteran lineman who could terrorize quarterbacks and easily explain how he did it.
Simmons was Buddy’s guy. He had 76 sacks and 2 Pro Bowl appearances when he joined the Arizona Cardinals as a free agent. He had played five years for Ryan in Philadelphia with the Eagles, and Ryan wanted him to help break in his new assistant.
Only 21 months younger than Rex Ryan , Simmons had 17 sacks and 73 tackles in two seasons for the Cardinals before Buddy Ryan was fired. Simmons joined the Chicago Bears, and Rex Ryan took a job at the University of Cincinnati . Until this year, they rarely saw each other.
Simmons retired in 2000 and moved to Georgia to be close to his family. He worked for a mortgage company and was a probation officer, which he said were fine ways for a former player to make a living until Simmons started going to his son’s high school football practices.
“I was watching them, and I was kind of disgusted,” Simmons said recently as he sat in the cafeteria at the Jets’ practice complex. “Some of the techniques just weren’t the proper stuff.”
Simmons was stoked. His children were growing up, and he knew the N.F.L. offered minority coaching fellowships — chances to sample coaching. It helped that another N.F.L. head coach with a first-year defensive line coach thought it might be a good idea to bring him on.
And that was how Simmons, 46, joined Rex Ryan and the Jets. Ryan said last week that Simmons would remain with the team for the rest of the season, as another minority fellowship coach , Chuck Smith, did last season. Simmons is helping the Jets become better pass-rushers.
Asked why he brought Simmons on board, Ryan said: “He’s an expert. He’s a guy that clearly the players would look up to, and they’d respect. I think he’s on the top 10 of the all-time sack list for this league, so it’s hard to ignore that fact and just the way he is, his personality. I had him in Arizona, and he was a leader back then for me when I was coaching defensive line. I thought he’d bring that to us, and he has. He’s been outstanding.”
Mark Carrier, 42, the Jets’ new defensive line coach, has four years of N.F.L. coaching experience with the Baltimore Ravens , but all were as a secondary coach. Carrier played against Simmons’s teams, and he remembered how Simmons liked to get after people.
“But everybody’s got to have a game plan,” Carrier said. “Rushing the passer is an art. You just don’t go out and do it.”
On the HBO series “Hard Knocks,” Simmons suggested in a meeting at training camp that someone should pick a fight with Vernon Gholston, the underachieving linebacker turned defensive end. Simmons was not joking. And, sure enough, Rob Turner, a reserve offensive lineman, got into it with Gholston.
Ryan said repeatedly in training camp that Gholston had improved, and Gholston says now that he is a better player because of Simmons. The fight stirred him up, but Gholston said Simmons has taught him so much more about the techniques of his position.
“If you’ve got technique, you can go a long way,” Gholston said.
Gholston does not have a sack in his N.F.L. career, but he knows that Simmons finished with 121. (Or, precisely, 121 ¬Ω.) Gholston says he follows Simmons’s advice on how to read blocks, take blocks and use his feet. He knows how and when to launch his hands into a lineman. Simmons does not say much, but that is nothing new. He was a ninth-round pick from Western Carolina who was probably the quietest member of a marauding, boisterous Eagles defense that included Reggie White , Jerome Brown, Andre Waters, Eric Allen and Seth Joyner.
According to Sione Pouha, the Jets’ sixth-year nose tackle, Simmons said nothing at all to the defensive linemen in the first days of training camp. Then he slowly began to offer advice on technique. He took his time to evaluate them. They took his critiques.
“How many offensive lines has he gone up against?” Pouha said.
Now they absorb every nugget. Among the players who paid the most attention to Simmons in camp, Carrier said, were Kris Jenkins, the 31-year-old nose tackle now out for the season with a knee injury, and Shaun Ellis , the defensive end who is in his 11th season — veterans.
“I’ve learned a lot of things just from the little time I’ve been here,” Simmons said. “It’s been a great working atmosphere. These guys come to work every day. I’ve been in places where the coaches don’t get along, and it boils over to the players.”
Simmons has a future in coaching, or so says Dennis Thurman, the Jets’ secondary coach. Thurman, 54, participated in the minority fellowship program with Baltimore. Simmons has old-fashioned football values and a work ethic, Thurman said, but he fits in today’s game.
“They know you from when you played, but they don’t know your skill set as a coach,” Thurman said of the merits of the fellowship. “You’re a name, but you’re not someone that coaches have had the opportunity to work with. But he does have a measure of respect. They know who he is. If you do not know who he is, then you’re not a real football fan.”
A lot has changed from when Simmons played. Full-contact drills — with tackling — were a practice staple, he said. Technique was important back then, but it is not as heavily emphasized as it is now. As punishing as the game is today, players are better at pacing themselves.
But some things are the same. Although Rex Ryan is more bubbly in public than his father (who got a bad rap, Simmons said), the two coaches have similar defensive philosophies. They both want their defenses to terrorize quarterbacks.
“Both are brutally honest,” Simmons said. “Sometimes, when you’re as honest as they are, people don’t want to hear that.”
Reminded that Buddy often scolded one of his players with a derisive quip, Simmons smiled and said: “I don’t think Buddy was mean-spirited. He was just truthful.”
Simmons will stay as long as the Jets want him here. But a door may open elsewhere. Smith is now the defensive line coach at the University of Tennessee . Four N.F.L. head coaches are graduates of the minority fellowship: Marvin Lewis of Cincinnati, Raheem Morris of Tampa Bay, Lovie Smith of Chicago and Mike Tomlin of Pittsburgh.
“It’s a great way of getting on-the-job training,” Simmons said. “It builds your r√©sum√©. But I’m also enjoying what I’m doing.”

But Beltran took it as a good sign that a magnetic resonance imaging examination Wednesday on his surgically repaired right knee showed nothing more than mild inflammation. Given the severity of his injury and the delicacy of his recovery, Beltran’s doctors recommended that he skip the Mets’ remaining games.
“I wanted to finish the season playing,” Beltran said between games of a doubleheader in which the Mets were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers , 8-7 and 3-1 .  But “I want to be good to go” in spring training next year.
Beltran left the Mets’ game Tuesday in the fifth inning with pain in his right knee, which had a bone bruise.
He started slowly after rejoining the team after the All-Star break but had batted .324 in his last 10 games. Over all, he played in 64 games, batting .255 with 7 home runs and 27 runs batted in.
“The good news is there’s nothing new,” Manager Jerry Manuel said of the results of Beltran’s examination.
After Manuel spoke, the Mets dropped the second game of the doubleheader. In the final outing of his surprising season, R. A. Dickey gave up one run and six hits in seven innings. The Mets, however, did not score a run while he was in the game and managed only five hits.
Dickey, who is expected to be re-signed by the Mets in the off-season, finished the year 11-9 with a 2.86 earned run average.
He said he exceeded his goals this season. “I learned I can contribute in ways that may have superseded what I thought I was capable of,” he said. “This doesn’t have to be an anomaly.”
While Dickey seemed to get stronger as the season wore on, Jon Niese headed in the other direction. Through August, Niese was one of the most consistent pitchers on a team starved for runs. But the Mets pushed their luck with Niese, who is completing his first full season in the major leagues and whose 2009 season was ended by a hamstring injury. Since late August, he had gone 1-5 with a 7.57 E.R.A.
Yet Manuel gave the Niese the ball one last time Wednesday hoping that he could earn his 10th win. But Niese proved again that the Mets might have been better shutting him down early.
Niese was removed with two outs in the third inning after he gave up six runs, the fifth time in his last seven starts that he yielded that many runs.
Niese did not suffer the indignity of losing his last start of the season. The Mets scored seven runs to take the lead before succumbing on Prince Fielder’s run-scoring single in the top of the eighth.
Still, Niese threw 173 2/3 innings this year, about 50 more than he pitched in the minor and major leagues last year. In an era when teams carefully monitor the wear and tear on their pitchers, the surge in Niese’s innings raises questions about how he will perform in 2011. His importance is likely to grow, too, because Johan Santana is unlikely to pitch much next year after having shoulder surgery.
Niese insisted that he was not overworked and that skipping a start or limiting his innings would not have made much difference. Rather, he said he was mentally fatigued by the grind of a long season.
“I wanted to get 10 wins, but it wasn’t in the cards,” said Niese, who ended the season 9-10 with a 4.20 E.R.A.
Manuel said that Niese “probably pressed a little bit to get there,” but that he had the talent to win 15 games.
“He’s a good left-hander,” Manuel said, “and they don’t come around too often.”
INSIDE PITCH
The Mets announced a paid attendance of 28,280 on Wednesday, but there appeared to be fewer than 10,000 present. ... Jerry Manuel used eight pitchers in the first game, tying a club record. ... Pedro Feliciano pitched in both games to extend his club record for appearances in a season to 91. ...During one pitching change in Game 2,  several fans yelled, “We want Ollie!” a reference to Oliver Perez, who has not pitched since Sept. 6.

Jure Robic, a long-distance bicyclist who won the grueling Race Across America five times and whose seemingly endless, sleep-eschewing stamina tested the limits of human endurance, died during a training ride on Friday when he collided with a car on a mountain road in Plavski Rovt, Slovenia, near his home in Jesenice. He was 45.

Race Across America
Jure Robic at the finish line of the 2008 Race Across America. Robic once rode 518.7 miles in 24 hours, a world record.
Primoz Kalisnik, a Slovene journalist and a friend of  Robic, said that the driver of the car, a 55-year-old local man who was not hurt, was not at fault, and that  Robic, who was going downhill on a mountain bike, may have been traveling as fast as 50 miles per hour on a narrow, winding stretch of unpaved road where it was impossible to see around the next bend. He was training for next month’s Crocodile Trophy mountain bike race in Australia, Kalisnik said.
Even in the circumscribed world of ultra-endurance athletes, Robic (his full name is pronounced YUR-eh ROH-bich) was known for his willingness, or his ability — or both — to push his body to extremes of fatigue. Compared by other riders to a machine and known to friends as Animal (a seeming contradiction that nonetheless made sense), he once rode 518.7 miles in 24 hours, a world record.
One occasional feature of his training regimen, which included daily rides or other workouts stretching between 6 and 10 hours, was a 48-hour period without sleep: a 24-hour ride followed by a 12-hour break followed by a 12-hour workout. Play, a magazine about sports that appeared in The New York Times, reported in 2006 that Robic rode 28,000 miles — more than the circumference of the Earth — every year.
His five victories in the Race Across America , an approximately 3,000-mile transcontinental ride that has been held annually since 1982, are unequaled. (The current course extends from Oceanside, Calif., to Annapolis, Md.)
Unlike the Tour de France , the Race Across America is not a stage race; once it begins, there is no respite for riders until they give up or cross the finish line, so determining when and how long to sleep is the event’s primary strategic element. The winner generally sleeps less than two hours out of 24 and finishes in less than nine days (although Robic’s winning time this past June was a relatively lethargic 9 days 46 minutes).
In 2005,  Robic won the race and two weeks later won Le Tour Direct, a 2,500-mile European version with a course derived from Tour de France routes that included 140,000 feet of climbing — almost the equivalent of starting at sea level and ascending Mt. Everest five times. His time was 7 days 19 hours.
Robic became accustomed to both the physical and mental stress that pushing himself to extremes brought on. In the later stages of long-distance races, feet swell as much as two sizes and thumb nerves go dull from the pressure of hands on handlebars.  Robic told Daniel Coyle, the Play magazine reporter, that for weeks after the Race Across America, he had to use two hands to turn a key.
“Don’t even ask about the derri√®re,” Mr. Coyle wrote. “When I did, Robic pantomimed placing a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger.”
The mental anguish may be worse. As each race went on,  Robic’s temper grew shorter and occasionally exploded. He was prone to hallucinations. More than once he leapt off his bicycle to do battle with threatening attackers who turned out to be mailboxes. Once he imagined he was being pursued by men with black beards on horseback — mujahedeen, he explained to his support team, who encouraged him to ride faster and keep ahead of them.
In 2003, the first time  Robic entered the Race Across America, finishing second,  Kalisnik volunteered to work on his team and was stunned by the changes the event wrought in Robic’s demeanor.
“We were just a group of guys helping a friend,” Kalisnik said. “We discovered someone we were absolutely afraid of.”
Robic knew this about himself.
“In race, everything inside me comes out,” he said. “Good, bad, everything. My mind, it begins to do things on its own. I do not like it, but this is the way I must go to win the race.”
Robic was born in Jesenice on April 10, 1965. From 1988 to 1994, he was a member of the Slovene national cycling team, and until recently he was a soldier in the Slovene army, a member of its athletic corps, which allowed him to train full time. (Among other methods employed during races to penetrate Robic’s numbing exhaustion and motivate him, his crew members, riding in a van behind him, sometimes blared Slovene military music through a loudspeaker.)
Robic’s marriage ended in divorce; he is survived by a half brother and a son. A brother, Saso, a former professional skier, committed  suicide earlier this year.
“He was two personalities within one body,” said Kalisnik, who called his friend the most popular athlete in Slovenia. “One was very polite and nice when he was not on the bike. During races, he was absolutely the most unpleasant person you could imagine.”

25;"Lance Armstrong is being investigated by a grand jury.

Times Topic: Lance Armstrong
On Wednesday morning, Allen Lim, an exercise physiologist for Team RadioShack who has worked closely with Armstrong this year, testified before the grand jury in Los Angeles, according to The Associated Press.
Lim wrote in an e-mail to The A.P. that he testified “openly and willingly.”
Next to testify is likely Kevin Livingston, a former Postal team rider who helped usher Armstrong through the mountains during two of Armstrong’s seven Tour de France victories.
Livingston runs his Pedal Hard training studio in Austin, Tex., out of Mellow Johnny’s Bike shop, which Armstrong co-owns. Livingston has been subpoenaed to appear in front of the grand jury, people close to the investigation said.
Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office for the Central District of California, declined to comment Wednesday on Lim’s testimony, Livingston’s coming testimony or any of the grand jury proceedings, which are done in secrecy.
In the coming weeks, though, the grand jury is likely to grow busier. Federal prosecutors are seeking an indictment by January, those close to the investigation said, because a statute of limitations for some of the suspected crimes expires that month.
The grand jury has already heard the testimony of several people who at one time were close to Armstrong. The former Postal rider Tyler Hamilton has already testified, as has Stephanie McIlvain, who worked with Armstrong as his liaison to the sunglasses company Oakley during the years he won the Tour.
Lim and Livingston, however, are the first people to testify who remain close to Armstrong.
On the United States Postal Service team, Armstrong and Livingston were clients of the Italian doctor Michele Ferrari, a trainer who had been charged with sporting fraud and malpractice before that conviction was overturned on appeal. Along with only a handful of other riders, Armstrong and Livingston were known to attend training camps together before each Tour.
When approached last week at Armstrong’s bike shop in Austin, Livingston was reluctant to talk about his involvement in the case.
“What investigation?” Livingston said. “Sorry, I don’t know. I can’t talk about that. Who’s mentioning my name? Who’s saying I’m involved? Which other riders are mentioning my name?”
Another former Postal rider, who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution from Armstrong, said that every rider on Postal was aware of the doping that occurred on the team — particularly among the riders who rode the Tour and other top races.
This spring, Floyd Landis — who won the 2006 Tour but was stripped of the title for doping — publicly said that he participated in an organized doping program on the United States Postal Service team and that Armstrong and other Postal riders did, too. He has filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit against Armstrong and other principals of the United States Postal Service team, claiming they defrauded the government.
After working as Landis’s personal training adviser, Lim was hired by what is now the Garmin-Transitions team, an American-based team known for its tough stance on antidoping. He left Garmin at the end of last year to join the RadioShack team.

But if the trial is coming to an end, the tribulations figure to continue for Dodgers fans as the wheels of justice are expected — like the trial itself — to grind forward slowly.
Judge Scott Gordon of Los Angeles Superior Court will render his decision in the case within 90 days, meaning that it may not come before free agency begins, raising questions about the Dodgers’ financial resources for another winter.
More disconcerting is that, barring a settlement, Gordon’s ruling may not be the final word. The loser in the case will most likely appeal, and with the way each side has spent on A-list lawyers — an estimated $9 million for Jamie McCourt — and the credit market still tight, the Dodgers will not be able to spend themselves into contention in one of baseball’s most competitive divisions .
Questions about Frank McCourt’s resources are one of several uncertainties surrounding the Dodgers, who floundered to fourth in the National League West and will have a rookie manager in Don Mattingly next season and a host of roster decisions to make before then.
When Frank McCourt was forced to acknowledge under oath that his plan when he bought the club was to raise ticket prices and slash payroll — contrary to his public pronouncements — it was the latest in a lengthy list of public relations hits he has taken since he and his wife filed for divorce the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs last October.
In recent weeks, the former Dodgers owner Peter O’Malley and newspaper columnists have beseeched Frank McCourt to sell , and Major League Baseball officials have acknowledged that they are monitoring the divorce. But McCourt, who declined to speak to reporters at the trial, said recently at Dodger Stadium that he had no intention of selling the club.
“If the Dodgers had won this season, nobody would be saying, ‘Oh my God, they have to sell the team,’¬†” said Steve Susman, Frank McCourt’s lead lawyer.
The one clear way for McCourt to keep the club would be to reach a settlement, but when the two sides spent Friday in closed-door negotiations, they appeared to be $300 million apart. He has offered $100 million; she is seeking $400 million.
Susman said he had “no idea” if the McCourts would settle, but Dennis Wasser, a lawyer for Jamie McCourt, said he expected them to once Gordon made a decision on the marital property agreement.
The key issue before Gordon is the validity of the marital property agreement — or agreements — the couple signed in 2004. (They married in 1979.)
It was discovered just before the start of the trial that some copies of the agreement excluded the Dodgers, who are owned by Frank McCourt, from the couple’s community property. Others included it.
Larry Silverstein , a Boston-based lawyer who drew up the document, admitted that he switched a page so that the Dodgers were excluded from the couple’s community property. Silverstein testified that he did so without telling the McCourts because he viewed it as a mere clerical error that would have no repercussions.
Wasser, making the case for Jamie McCourt’s legal team, said the differences in the testimony of Silverstein and Frank McCourt during depositions and the trial were a result of “reverse engineering” after the document switch came to light.
Wasser argued that because of the discrepancy and because Jamie McCourt did not have her own counsel, the agreement should be thrown out and all of the couple’s property should be distributed equitably.
“There’s three main actors: Frank, Jamie and Silverstein,” Wasser said. “The only one whose testimony hasn’t changed is Jamie’s.”
After Wasser’s nearly three-hour closing argument, Frank McCourt’s legal team made its case that what matters most is the intent of the postnuptial agreement: to insulate Jamie McCourt from her husband’s business risks.
“These people can and did make an agreement with each other, and it is a valid and binding agreement,” said Sorrell Trope, one of Frank McCourt’s lawyers.
Trope, a well-known divorce lawyer who represented Tiger Woods ’s ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, injected some levity into a dreary day with his conversational approach. He regularly engaged Gordon, and after joking with Wasser about his list of questions, said, “You can smile, too.” And Wasser did.
Susman followed Trope and painted the testimony of Silverstein as irrelevant and a distraction.
“They’ve created a lynch-Larry mentality,” Susman said. Jamie McCourt, he added, “tried to turn a mistake, an uncorrected drafting error, into her entire case.”

27;"The Rays gave away 20,000 tickets for their regular-season home finale. Fans began lining up outside Tropicana Field several hours before game time. The team said the allotment of free tickets was exhausted about 45 minutes before the first pitch.
“I think it’s cool, absolutely,” pitcher David Price said of the ticket giveaway.
Tampa Bay clinched its second playoff berth in three years before 17,891 on Tuesday night. Monday night’s potential clincher drew 12,446, a number that moved Evan Longoria, who missed his sixth straight game Wednesday and was to be re-evaluated Thursday, and Price to complain about a lack of fan support.
“They know they’re in, but they also know these games are meaningful,” Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said. “So you realize it when you’re able to shut them out here in their own place and that environment.”
The Rays kept a half-game lead in the American League East because of the Yankees ’ 8-4 loss at Toronto.
The victory ensured Baltimore (63-95) — 31-22 under Showalter — will not lose 100 games this year.
“I don’t think anybody in contention really cares to play this team right now,” Millwood said.
HAMILTON PLANS RETURN Josh Hamilton, taking swings in the batting cage for the third straight day, said he hoped to return to the Rangers ’ lineup by Friday. Hamilton has been out since he broke two ribs after crashing into an outfield wall Sept. 4 at Minnesota.
Manager Ron Washington said that although Hamilton would return at the end of the regular season as a designated hitter, he would be in the outfield in the playoffs.
In the Rangers’ game, Mitch Moreland raced home from first base for the winning run after a wild pitch and a throwing error on a strikeout with two outs in the ninth inning, lifting host Texas over the Seattle Mariners , 6-5.
CABRERA OUT FOR REST OF YEAR Detroit Tigers Manager Jim Leyland announced that Miguel Cabrera, whose 126 runs batted in lead the majors, would not play again this season because of a sprained right ankle.
Cabrera was injured on a pickoff attempt at first base Monday night.
In the first game of the Tigers’ doubleheader against the host Indians , a 4-0 Cleveland victory, Johnny Damon played his 140th game of the season. Damon, 36, became one of only five major leaguers to reach that total for 15 straight seasons.
Hank Aaron , Brooks Robinson and Pete Rose played that many games for 16 straight years, and Willie Mays did it for 15.
Damon’s streak began in his second season with the Kansas City Royals , in 1996.
BRAVES CLOSE IN ON PLAYOFFS The Braves moved closer to their first playoff berth since 2005, beating the Florida Marlins , 5-1, behind Derek Lowe’s fifth win of September and completing a three-game sweep. Atlanta began the day one and a half games ahead of San Diego in the National League wild-card race.
PIRATES LOCK UP NO. 1 PICK The Pittsburgh Pirates, with their first 100-loss season since 2001, have been guaranteed the No. 1 pick in the June amateur draft because they cannot finish ahead of any other team in the overall standings. They last had the No. 1 pick in 2002. The Pirates have 102 losses going into their final four games.

Dez Bryant bought an expensive dinner for his teammates.
Manningham had medical tests Monday,  and Coach Tom Coughlin said he appeared to be fine. On Wednesday, Manningham performed balance and coordination tests, according to a team spokesman, but did not undergo the ImPACT test, a computerized evaluation of memory, brain processing and visual motor skills.
“He’ll be tested again, and we’ll see how that comes out,” Coughlin said Wednesday. “We’re a little bit surprised that there’s an issue.”
Coughlin did not know the severity of the concussion or when Manningham sustained it during the game. It was also unknown whether Manningham felt the effects of the concussion during the game or if the symptoms developed later. Manningham had six catches for 78 yards, which does not include a 43-yard reception in the third quarter that was nullified because of a penalty.
For the season Manningham leads the Giants with 238 yards receiving.
In Manningham’s place, the Giants temporarily made the rookie Victor Cruz their third receiver in practice. Cruz,  an undrafted free agent out of the University of Massachusetts , won over the front office and fans alike with a strong preseason, highlighted by a three-touchdown performance against the Jets on Aug. 16.
JAGUAR ESCAPES GUNMAN Kassim Osgood, a Jacksonville Jaguars receiver, leaped out of a second-floor window Monday night to escape a gun-wielding man who attacked him and a 19-year-old woman, the gunman’s ex-girlfriend, the police said.
The intruder assaulted the woman, Mackenzie Rae Putnal, who later escaped and exchanged gunfire with him, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.
Julian Armond Bartletto, 20, of Jacksonville, was arrested on charges of aggravated battery, false imprisonment , armed robbery, burglary and violation of an injunction. He was being held without bond at the Duval County Jail.
According to the sheriff’s report, Osgood, 30, sustained some minor bruises.
“He’s fine,” Jaguars Coach Jack Del Rio said Wednesday. The Florida Times-Union first reported the altercation. (AP)
COSTLY LESSON FOR COWBOY Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant knew there would be payback for his refusal to carry teammate Roy Williams’s shoulder pads in training camp. The check seemed to come due this week at the traditional rookie-picks-up-the-tab dinner. The damage: $54,896. The meal at a steakhouse was supposed to be only for offensive players, but the guest list expanded beyond 20, said Bryant’s adviser, David Wells . (AP)
POLIAN REVISES ‘FAIT ACCOMPLI’ Bill Polian, the president of the Indianapolis Colts , said he was “very imprecise” when he described an 18-game schedule as a done deal.
Two days after saying on his local radio show that a longer schedule was a “fait accompli,” Polian returned to the airwaves Wednesday and told ESPN ’s “Mike and Mike in the Morning” program that he meant to say that the Colts were preparing as if the 18-game season would happen.
On Tuesday, players union representatives and league officials met in Washington to discuss a new collective bargaining agreement. The expanded season was one of the topics.
Polian said the competition committee, which he serves on, was discussing how to make it work. A proposal would have to be discussed with the union and approved by league owners. (AP)
REVIS STILL QUESTIONABLE It might be another week before Darrelle Revis plays again for the Jets.
Revis, the All-Pro cornerback, did not practice Wednesday, spending part of the session on a stationary bike and also working with a trainer on the side. Revis is recovering from a strained left hamstring, and his availability for the team’s game at Buffalo on Sunday remains uncertain.
“He’s still questionable there,” Coach Rex Ryan said. “But I don’t want to rule him out yet ... because I’d hate to be fined by the league if he did play.”
Ryan has said the team wants Revis to be completely healed before he takes the field again. Revis was injured in the first half of the Jets’ win over New England. If Revis does not play, Ryan said there was a chance Drew Coleman could get the start over the  struggling rookie Kyle Wilson opposite Antonio Cromartie. (AP)
JET HAS SUCCESSFUL SURGERY Jets nose tackle Kris Jenkins had surgery on his left knee Wednesday. The doctors, Ken Montgomery and Elliott Hershman, told Jenkins’s wife that they repaired his anterior cruciate ligament, which he also tore last year. They also did some work on the meniscus but found less damage there, as it had already started to heal. They also discovered a bone bruise. GREG BISHOP

When C.C. Sabathia joined the Yankees in December 2008, he came with two nagging questions. The first was whether Sabathia, raised in California and a veteran of smaller markets, really wanted to play in New York. The second was whether he could handle the postseason.
Sabathia answered the first question in spring training, when he assumed a leadership role through the gentle force of his welcoming personality. He took the corner locker in the clubhouse at Steinbrenner Field, where he could see everyone. He took fellow pitchers fishing or to basketball games. He consoled pitchers who had been cut.
There was no doubting Sabathia’s sincerity. The Yankees paid him $161 million , the largest amount ever guaranteed to a pitcher, and when he took it, he gave up any thoughts he might have entertained about playing elsewhere. He was all in.
The regular season played out as expected, a lot of wins and a few losses. In the postseason, he shook the other suspicion, that he somehow wilted on the big stage. In five playoff starts for Cleveland and Milwaukee, his earned run average was 7.92. In five starts last fall for the Yankees, it was 1.98.
The man who came to the Yankees at 6 feet 7 inches and 309 pounds was still growing — mentally, anyway. He was an ace in full, and he has repeated the act for the playoff-bound Yankees of 2010.
“I just feel like I can handle it a little more,” Sabathia said in the festive visitors’ clubhouse at Rogers Centre on Tuesday, after his 6-1 victory over the Blue Jays lifted the Yankees to the postseason. “I was a little young in Cleveland and would get emotional at times, wasn’t able to handle some starts. But being able to come here and deal with everything throughout the year definitely helps me in the playoffs and postseason.”
Sabathia worked eight and a third innings Tuesday night, allowing three hits and an earned run, walking  two and striking out eight. Twice he humbled the major league home run leader, Jose Bautista, with his signature wipeout slider. The wobbly Yankees looked sturdy again.
“That’s why they got him,” said Derek Jeter , the captain. “C. C.’s arguably the best pitcher in baseball. That goes without saying. He’s the guy that you want on the mound. He’s capable of dominating great teams. He always seems to step it up when we need it most.”
It was not always that way with the Indians . Sabathia won his first playoff start, in 2001, but six years later he was horrible. Sabathia’s regular season produced a Cy Young award, but he was lucky to beat the Yankees in Game 1 of the division series, and was lit up twice by the Boston Red Sox in the next round.
One of those losses, in Game 5, came at home with the Indians holding a three-games-to-one lead in the series. A win that night would have clinched a World Series berth. Sabathia gave up 10 hits and four runs in six innings.
Traded to Milwaukee the next season, he seemed to personally will the Brewers to their first postseason appearance in 26 years. But in his lone playoff start, in Philadelphia, he walked the opposing pitcher, Brett Myers, before another walk and a backbreaking second-inning grand slam by Shane Victorino.
Yankees fans might expect something like that from other imports, like A. J. Burnett or Javier Vazquez , or from earlier disappointments, like Randy Johnson or Jaret Wright . But in Sabathia, their biggest pitching investment of all, the Yankees got it right.
“No. 1, ace, is probably the easiest way to put it,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “You get wins, you get outstanding performances. He stops losing streaks, he gives you innings, he gives the bullpen the night off. I mean, he’s tremendous.”
Girardi could have added that he gives the manager flexibility. Sabathia never seems to stress very much about too much rest or too little. He started twice on short rest last fall, and the Yankees won both times.
He will start the playoff opener next Wednesday after seven days off. Although he has had mixed results on extra rest — a 6-7 record and a 5.32 E.R.A. in 15 regular-season starts, according to the Elias Sports Bureau — he brushed off the risk.
“I’m sure I’ll throw a couple of bullpens and be ready to go on Wednesday,” he said.
The Yankees have problems, but Sabathia is not one of them. He has made 22 starts this season in which he pitched at least seven innings and allowed no more than three earned runs. Only two pitchers in baseball have more — the Phillies ’ Roy Halladay , with 23, and Seattle’s Felix Hernandez, with 25.
Hernandez is 13-12 with a 2.27 E.R.A., nearly a run better than Sabathia, who will finish at 3.18, with a 21-7 record. Hernandez leads the league in E.R.A., innings and strikeouts, historically an unbeatable combination in Cy Young voting.
Still, to his obviously biased teammates, there is only one choice. Maybe it was the Champagne talking, but here is what Nick Swisher said: “Two words: Cy Young. No doubt, man.”
Sabathia said he was not paying attention to the awards debate. You get the feeling he is beyond that now.
“That’s up to you guys to decide,” Sabathia told the writers. “I’ll just keep going out and try to win a championship.”

Danilo Gallinari is much too young to remember the last tall Italian who played for the Knicks and who was also something of a big deal in Gallinari country, on the streets of Milan.
In fact, his last name also begins with a G. In New York basketball circles, John Gianelli was known as the G-Man, and the mention of his name brought an instant smile to Mike D’Antoni ’s mustachioed face.
“A great guy, a little different,” D’Antoni said. “Last I heard, he was living up in the mountains of Northern California.”
Gianelli was a mop-haired member of the Knicks’ 1973 championship team , a reserve center, before drifting over to Italy in the early 1980s. He played for an Olimpia Milano team that in 1982 found itself in the championship game of the Italian League against a rival, Pesaro.
With about a half-minute to play, his team trailing by 1, Gianelli found himself double-teamed in the post and whipped a pass out to the perimeter, into the hands of the star guard.
“I hit the jumper and we won — my first championship,” D’Antoni said.
D’Antoni was such a hit he remained in Milan for 17 years, coaching for the last four. He noted that Bill Bradley played for the same Milan team in the mid-1960s, while juggling academic pursuits at Oxford. And then along came Gallinari, the Knicks’ first serious investment in basketball’s true global age, connecting the dots and the decades, Milan to Madison Square Garden.
Wednesday’s journey across the Atlantic for Sunday’s preseason opener against Armani Jeans Milano — same team, new sponsor — was the talk of training camp Tuesday, providing relief from the already oppressive Carmelo Anthony updates, none of which seem to involve the Knicks. And won’t any time soon, according to Donnie Walsh , their president for basketball operations.
“No chance,” he said to the question of whether the Knicks might commit the public relations sin of dealing the 22-year-old Gallinari for Anthony while parading him around the city in which he was a professional neophyte and where his father, Vittorio, was a teammate of D’Antoni’s.
If this sounds like one big happy transcontinental family, it’s not. “It’s a business,” Walsh said, tacit acknowledgment that Gallinari would probably be the first Knick to be extended a handshake and a one-way ticket to Denver if the Nuggets woke up and realized that some combination of the Knicks’ young players might actually be better than the package reportedly offered in the deal that includes the Nets .
Walsh is operating with the impression that the Nuggets will continue to explore options after the four-team extravaganza that was seemingly close to being done — sort of like LeBron James ’s early-summer deals with Chicago and Cleveland — rolled out of bounds.
If Anthony somehow winds up with the Nets, the Knicks will grit their teeth and have to live with it. If nothing happens soon, Walsh will be thrilled to watch what his assortment of young talent can do in orbit around Amar’e Stoudemire, the $99.7 million man.
If Gallinari, Anthony Randolph, Wilson Chandler and the newly imported Russian center Timofey Mozgov are as promising as the Knicks are obligated to say they are, Walsh, who remains in a wheelchair as he recovers from neck surgery, will be sitting pretty. In an absolute best-case scenario, he may even refrain from disassembling his nucleus and build a contender the old-fashioned way, antithetical to Miami.
But until someone proves otherwise, Gallinari remains the most intriguing member of Club Unknown.
“If Gallo came out this year, he would have been a No. 1,” D’Antoni said, meaning of the entire draft. John Wall would have a winning argument there, but Gallinari, beginning his third N.B.A. season, would most assuredly be selected before Evan Turner and Derrick Favors — the Nets’ primary bait in the proposed Anthony deal — knowing what we already know.
Gallinari averaged 15.1 points and 4.9 rebounds last season. How good can he be?
“I don’t think you should put any limit on him because he’s a rare talent,” D’Antoni said. “He’s a guy who knows how to play at 6-10, defends pretty well, shoots the ball extremely well with unbelievable range — so it comes down to confidence, putting the necessary work in. He’s going to be a good player, but now you have to dissect him, look into his heart to see how good.”
Not that the Nuggets are inclined to consult their superstar forward, Anthony, whose first relocation choice is the Knicks. But Anthony already went on record after Gallinari dropped 24 of his 28 points on the Nuggets in the second half of a rare Knicks victory at the Garden last March.
“He has gotten a lot better since he first came in,” Anthony said. “I think he’s coming along big time.”
Gallinari is apparently unafraid to tell us — or Anthony — about it either. That night, he talked as much trash to Anthony as he heard.
“I never back down,” he said Tuesday, sounding like a child of the American youth system. “Nobody should back down. We are players; everybody’s a man. I respect his game, but I respect myself, too.”
The temerity is what Walsh and D’Antoni like most about Gallinari. Along with the skills, he walks with a strut. Maybe the Nuggets have been blinded to Gallinari’s upside by the four walls of the box they find themselves in. Maybe they will wake up soon enough on Gallinari and Anthony will get his way after all.
In the meantime, Gallinari will have his day in Milan, a 21st-century G-Man still hoping to make some Knicks history of his own.

Week 4 N.F.L. Game Probabilities: Thumbs Up to Bears and Browns
By BRIAN BURKE
Brian Burke, a former Navy pilot who has taken up the less dangerous hobby of N.F.L. statistical analysis,   operates Advanced NFL Stats , a blog about  football, math and human behavior.
Weekly game probabilities start up again for Week 4. Last season, the prediction model did well, outguessing the consensus favorites more often than not. The probabilities are based on core efficiency stats, including offensive and defensive passing and running efficiencies, turnover rates and penalty rates. Each efficiency stat is weighted according to how well they combine to predicted game outcomes over the past eight N.F.L. seasons. The model also adjusts for each team’s previous opponent strength and factors in home-field advantage.
There are only three games’ worth of data, so things are certain to change. But this is the time to set aside our preseason opinions of which teams are supposed to be good, and start looking at the teams that are actually playing well.
What I look for is games where the model’s prediction diverges from the general consensus and try to figure out why. For example, the model has the Browns favored over the Bengals, although most experts give the upper hand to Cincinnati. I think the Browns are underestimated because they’re “supposed” to be a doormat. Plus, the Bengals’ offense has performed worse than many people probably realize.
Somehow the experts have the Giants favored against the Bears, despite Chicago’s impressive performance so far this year. The Giants have been struggling at times, while the Bears lead the league in offensive pass efficiency, the single best predictor of success.
The season is young, but it’s not too early to start ranking teams. Last year, the model’s two top ranked teams after Week 3 went on to meet in the Super Bowl. If only N.F.L. predictions were really that easy…Actually, let’s be glad they’re not. Then it would be more like Major League Baseball!

The 17-Game Solution to the N.F.L.’s Problem
Players are against the 18-game season, as are many fans. (Given the response to Andy Benoit’s blog post on Wednesday, most of our readers are, too).
But it is inevitable that the N.F.L. will add games.
Clark Judge of CBSSports.com has a compromise plan: a 17-game regular season, with three preseason games.
Put the 17th game at a neutral site, and you satisfy fans, players, coaches, marketing departments, virtually everyone but owners who would sacrifice earnings from another home date.
O.K, this idea isn’t exactly new. But Judge gives it a little twist. The N.F.L. would like to expand to other countries, and neutral-site games are thought to be perfect for this purpose. But Judge says we should  also consider home fans. Could the Eagles and Steelers play at Penn State?   Could the N.F.L. host two games in Los Angeles in one weekend and create a happening? Judge writes:
Maybe you could make it something along the lines of what the NHL does with its “Winter Classic” on New Year’s Day. If the NHL can play hockey where it hasn’t played hockey before, why can’t the NFL play football where it doesn’t play football now?
The NHL idea was brilliant, with fans who never thought of attending a pro hockey game suddenly interested in seeing one played at Fenway Park or Wrigley Field or Heinz Field. So create interest in areas where the NFL isn’t played by taking it there for a weekend.
Extra point: Does this plan have merit, and what are some other ideas for neutral-site extravaganzas?

Giants Surprised by Manningham’s Concussion
By MARK VIERA
Giants wide receiver Mario Manningham sustained a concussion in a 29-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans but did not alert the medical staff until Sunday night. Manningham did not practice Wednesday, and his status for Sunday night’s game against the Bears is uncertain. He was unavailable for comment on Wednesday.
Manningham had medical tests Monday, and Coach Tom Coughlin said he appeared to be fine. On Wednesday, Manningham performed balance and coordination tests, according to a team spokesman, but did not undergo the ImPACT test, a computerized evaluation of memory, brain processing and visual motor skills.
“He’ll be tested again, and we’ll see how that comes out,” Coughlin said Wednesday. “We’re a little bit surprised that there’s an issue.”
Coughlin did not know the severity of the concussion or when Manningham sustained it during the game. It was also unknown whether Manningham felt the effects of the concussion during the game or if the symptoms developed later. Manningham had six catches for 78 yards, which does not include a 43-yard reception in the third quarter that was nullified because of a penalty.
For the season, Manningham leads the Giants with 238 yards receiving.
In Manningham’s place, the Giants temporarily made the rookie Victor Cruz their third receiver in practice. Cruz, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Massachusetts, won over the front office and fans alike with a strong preseason, highlighted by a three-touchdown performance against the Jets on Aug. 16.

If You’re the Yankees, Do You Want the Twins or the Rangers?
By KENNETH PLUTNICKI
C. C. Sabathia, the Yankees’ ace, is preparing to pitch in Game 1 of the American League division series, but against whom?
The American League East champion — either the Yankees or the Tampa Bay Rays — will play the Texas Rangers in one division series. The A.L. wild-card winner — the Yankees or the Rays — will play the Minnesota Twins, the A.L. Central champion, in the other.
The Yankees are a half-game behind Tampa Bay in the A.L. East, and on track to play Minnesota with four regular-season games remaining, one Wednesday night in Toronto and three in Boston.
Tampa Bay has five games remaining, one at home Wednesday night against Baltimore, then four at Kansas City.
Because the Rays won 10 of the 18 games in their season series with the Yankees, they own the tie breaker. In essence then, the Yankees are a game and a half behind in the A.L. East race and that much more likely to face Minnesota next week.
The Yankees were 4-2 against the Twins this season, all in May, losing two times to the right-hander Nick Blackburn (10-11). The Yankees  were 2-1 at Target Field and 2-1 at Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees were 4-4 against the Rangers this season, sweeping three games at the Stadium in April, and going 1-4 at Texas. The Yankees lost to Cliff Lee twice this season; on Sept. 12, 4-1 , and on June 29, in a complete game when he was still with Seattle, 7-4 .
Lee got a no-decision in the Yankees’ 7-6 victory over the Rangers on Aug. 11, in which Lee allowed four runs and eight hits in six and a third innings.
The Rangers will most likely go with a three-man rotation: Lee (4-6 with Texas and 8-3 with Seattle), another left-hander, C. J. Wilson (14-8), and the right-hander Colby Lewis (12-13). Tommy Hunter (13-4) would most likely work from the bullpen.
Against the Twins, the Yankees would most likely face Francisco Liriano (14-9), Carl Pavano (17-11), Brian Duensing (10-3) and Blackburn.
History will be on the Yankees’ side against either opponent. In the late 1990s, the Rangers were a perennial playoff opponent and the Yankees beat them three times, in 1996, 1998 and 1999. Over all, the Yankees are 9-1 against Texas in the division series. In the 2000s, the Yankees saw a lot of the Twins, and beat them in 2003, 2004 and 2009, going 9-2 against them.
Which team do Yankees fans want to face in the division series, the Rangers or the Twins? Which team provides the easier path?

Nothing Is Easy for the Braves
By RAY GLIER
ATLANTA — The threadbare Braves, who have lost third baseman Chipper Jones and starting pitcher Kris Medlen to injury, and battled through all manner of slumps, bumps and bruises this season, took another hit Tuesday night. Infielder Martin Prado, who had been the team’s most consistent hitter this season (.307), was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hip pointer and oblique muscle injury.
It figures.
The Braves have been limping toward the finish of the season with a lineup that has been overhauled from top to bottom since spring training. They were a half-game ahead of San Diego at the start of play Tuesday and were using pitcher Tim Hudson on three days rest.
The Braves, who were in first place roughly from Memorial Day to Labor Day, are 11-14 in August. And they cannot hit. Through four innings Tuesday night, the Braves had hit one ball out of the infield. They had scored 16 runs in seven games before Tuesday night’s game with the Marlins.
It is the last season for Manager Bobby Cox, who is retiring, and festivities are planned for throughout the weekend series with the Phillies. One of the few managers who still wears cleats, Cox’s last game in a Braves uniform will be Sunday unless his team uncovers a hot bat.
* Scoreboard watching is a lot different for Cox now than when he first started taking the Braves to the playoffs. He listened to the Padres-Cubs game on the radio on his car ride home Monday night following the Braves’ 2-1 win over the Marlins in 11 innings. Cox delighted at the work of Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano. He listened as Carlos Marmol, the Cubs’ relief pitcher, struck out the first two hitters of the ninth while protecting a 1-0 lead. Then Cox lost the satellite radio signal as he entered his garage.
He hustled into the house, said hello to his wife, Pam, sat down in his chair and turned on his phone to see what happened at the finish. It was not over. Cox saw three dots on the screen of his phone signaling three runners on base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.
“Pam, you’re not going to believe this,” he said.
“I put the phone aside and said I’m not looking at it for five minutes. Yeesh!”
Marmol got the final out. The Braves had a half-game lead in the wild-card race.

Alabama Puts Up a Wall Against the Run
By RAY GLIER
New England Patriots running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, an undrafted free agent out of Mississippi, went for 98 yards Sunday in the Patriots’ 38-30 victory over Buffalo. Some fans might not be impressed considering the Bills are 0-3 and 27th in the N.F.L. in run defense.
Maybe this will impress them: Green-Ellis is the last player to gain 100 yards rushing against the University of Alabama.
The Crimson Tide has not given up a 100-yard game to an opposing back since Oct. 13, 2007, when he had 131 yards. That is a streak of 38 games, the longest in Division I, according to the university.
Now, consider what Alabama routinely does on the ground to opposing defenses with running backs Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson. Bama is averaging 244 yards rushing a game.
In the era of the spread offense and the 3-4 defense, with its emphasis on speed, Alabama still plays a physical brand of football.
Alabama rushed for 227 yards against Arkansas, but it also protected quarterback Greg McElroy fairly well throughout the game. McElroy was sacked twice, but one was because receivers could not get open and the other was on a blitz.
The Alabama offensive line includes left tackle James Carpenter, left guard Chance Warmack, center William Vlachos, right guard Barrett Jones and right tackle D. J. Fluker. It is a cohesive group coached by Joe Pendry, a former N.F.L. assistant coach who has West Virginia roots like the head coach, Nick Saban.
The Alabama defensive line is strong enough to fight off blocks at the point of attack and get into the run play with a charge upfield. It has a first-round draft pick in defensive lineman Marcell Dareus and fast 3-4 linebackers Dont’a Hightower and Courtney Upshaw.
Alabama is the only college team not to allow a 100-yard rushing game in 2008 and 2009 and that is while playing in what is considered the toughest conference in college football.
Alabama’s defense presents a challenge for No. 7 Florida, which is trying to get its run-game in order without the physical presence of Tim Tebow. The Gators rushed for 176 yards against Kentucky last Saturday, but top rusher Jeff Demps has been slowed by an injured foot.
The Gators (4-0) are going to have to run Saturday night in Tuscaloosa if they hope to win. Teams with just one dimension on offense do not have much chance against Alabama, which has won 28 straight regular season games.

Assumption College Takes Big Steps Up
By DAVE CALDWELL
Fordham scheduled Assumption College, an N.C.A.A. Division II team from Worcester, Mass., as its homecoming opponent Saturday. Big white tents were set up outside Jack Coffey Field, but the game was not such a celebration for Fordham, which lost, 30-24 .
When the Assumption players headed back to their locker room after mobbing one another at midfield, one player turned to Fordham players and fans and loudly scolded them for considering Assumption a homecoming cupcake.
“I hope we stay a secret,” Assumption Coach Cory Bailey , a Fordham alumnus, said.
Assumption is 4-0, with upset victories this year over Fordham and Wagner of the  Football  Championship Subdivision, but the Greyhounds were considered an easy victory not that long ago. Their intercollegiate record in football is 72-148-1.
“By no means would we be confused with an athletic factory,” said Ted Paulauskis, the athletic director at Assumption, which is not far from Holy Cross.
Assumption, with 2,100 students, has had a varsity football team since 1988. Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly was a linebacker and coach for Assumption in the 1980s, when it was a club team.
Before last year, the Greyhounds posted 13 straight losing seasons. The student body was apathetic. Even last year, when it finished 6-4, Assumption drew a total of 3,837 to its five home games.
“We always say no one knows how good we are except for us,” said David Canney, a senior wide receiver from Templeton, Mass., who caught a career-high 16 passes Saturday.
Bailey, then 27, was named Assumption’s coach in 2004, and the Greyhounds won only 13 games in four seasons. He quit and took a job for a year working for a staffing agency. He came back after the college increased its commitment to football.
“It was great financially,” Bailey said of working in the private sector, “but this happened to be something I’ve always done. It just recharged me.”
Bailey runs a wide-open offense and takes chances — his team was 3 for 3 on fourth-down conversions Saturday — which has helped entice players who were  overlooked. Assumption was the only Division II school that recruited the senior quarterback Andrew Kupec.
“I kind of flew under the radar,” he said.
Kupec, from Wyckoff, N.J., was magnificent Saturday, passing for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns, including one to Marcus Nichols with 5 minutes 31 seconds left that gave the Greyhounds the lead for good. A Hail Mary pass by Fordham on the last play was incomplete.
Several hundred Assumption fans in the crowd of 5,135 cheered when the Greyhounds walked off the field. Paulauskis said he wanted to thank Fordham for scheduling the nonconference game against Assumption, a member of the Northeast-10 Conference.
“We’re always scratching for those two or three extra games,” Paulauskis said.
Paulauskis joked that Assumption sports teams rarely made the front page of the paper. But the college does recruit hard in the New York metropolitan area, and with victories in football over Wagner and Fordham, Assumption may just become more enticing than it used to be.
“Everybody loves to play now, because everybody’s confident we can win,” Canney said. “The expectations are totally different than they were in years past.”

Boise State’s Moore Ignores, and Justifies, Heisman Hype
By PETE THAMEL
BOISE, Idaho — The night before Boise State played Oregon State, Kellen Moore hung out with his family in the lobby of a nearby Courtyard Marriott. He wore flip flops and cargo shorts and blended in seamlessly with a lobby full of fans, loitering members of the news media and travelers waiting to check in.
At a sliver under 6 feet, Moore is the everyman quarterback. His shaggy hair and unimposing physique could help him blend in everywhere from a fraternity couch to an intramural team. But the numbers he has put up this year and last  make him an obvious Heisman Trophy contender.
“Totally impressed,” Oregon State Coach Mike Riley said Saturday after Boise State’s 37-24 victory . “Hard to sack. He’s got a total grasp of everything they’re doing. He’s a wonderful quarterback, one of the most efficient guys we’ve ever played against.”
Moore threw for 39 touchdowns and just 3 interceptions last year.  After tossing three touchdowns passes against Oregon State, he is on a similar pace this season. Moore has thrown eight touchdown passes and one interception this year, numbers that should only improve as the Broncos’  schedule softens. And although he is on everyone’s Heisman list, Moore looked sheepish when asked a question about his candidacy.
“That’s a great question for other people,” Moore said.
Because it goes against the DNA of the Boise State program to manufacture hype, Coach Chris Petersen said  Sunday to not expect a Heisman campaign for Moore.
He said he was not sure if college football traditionalists would vote for a player from Boise State to win the Heisman.
“I don’t know, and I don’t get that excited about it one way or another,” he said. He added: “If a guy is good enough, and the team is good enough, and everyone believes that, which with us it’s always going to be controversial, so I don’t know.”
As Moore’s numbers keep growing, it will be easier and easier for him to blend in with stars from traditional powers.

After Long Injury Layoff, Westwood Says He Is Ready to Play
By LARRY DORMAN
NEWPORT, Wales — Lee Westwood of England was introduced as “Europe’s No. 1 player” for his Thursday morning interview in the Ryder Cup media center, and nothing in his body language or spoken words to indicate he will be anything less this week.
Swatting aside any lingering concerns about his fitness for play, the 37-year-old Westwood, veteran of six Cup competitions, pronounced himself and his European teammates ready to go in the 38th playing of the biennial matches against the United States team that begin Friday.
The torn calf tendon that has kept him out of competition since his withdrawal from the W.G.C.-Bridgestone Championship in early August is not an issue, he said, and he is prepared to go all five matches if necessary, starting with the morning four-ball on Friday.
“I don’t have concern with the competitive edge,” said Westwood, whose 16½ career Ryder Cup points are the most on either team. “I’ve played well in the practice rounds, and I don’t see how that’s going to change in the competitive rounds. And when the match itself starts, I think I’ll be up for it even more.
“I wouldn’t be here if I don’t think I could play five matches.”
Count Westwood is among those who believe the Europeans have the prematch momentum this year, which was absent in 2008 at Valhalla, in Kentucky, where the United States soundly defeated the Europeans, 16½-11½.
In an indirect swipe at Nick Faldo, who captained the Europeans in 2008, Westwood said it was not passion the Europeans lacked that year.
“I think there was a lot of passion at Valhalla,” Westwood said. “But I think I don’t think it was directed or guided in the right direction at times. I think we could have pulled it together as a team a lot better at Valhalla. We are all working in the same direction here for sure. This is one of the best atmospheres I’ve ever been to at a Ryder Cup.”
For that, Westwood gave a lot of credit to the sometimes-volatile European captain, Colin Montgomerie, saying Mongomerie had been a little more relaxed in the role than he was as a player and that “his mood swings have been less.”
“This week, because whatever he does is directly influenced onto the team, I think he wants to be on an even keel, and sort of nice and calm,” Westwood said. “You know, he’s been a good captain, great captain so far, not one foot wrong in my book.”
What that means once the matches begin will be determined. What it means at the moment is that the European team leader is fit, of one accord with the captain and believes the team is as well. If true, that could portend a long weekend for the United States.

Karl Stays Positive About the Anthony Situation
By JOHN BRANCH
Coach George Karl is in the middle of the odd marriage between Carmelo Anthony and the Denver Nuggets, who start training camp on Tuesday.
Anthony, the All-Star forward, is entering the final year of his contract, much as LeBron James was a year before. The Nuggets, seeing that Anthony is in no hurry to sign a three-year, $65-million extension, are looking at trades, hoping to get something for Anthony before he walks away for nothing next summer, as James did in Cleveland this summer.
Karl, coming off a brutal six months of treatment and recovery from throat cancer , is entering the final year of his contract, just like Anthony. He believes Denver can contend for a championship. But he would like to have Anthony around to make it happen.
“Even if he’s unhappy when he’s here, he will figure out that the energy of being free come next summer, it’s worth playing the right way this year,” Karl said in an interview in Denver about 10 days ago. ” ‘Melo, if that’s your choice, that’s our choice, but let’s not make it a lose-lose. Let’s make it a win-win. Let’s come to June 30 as friends, shaking hands, because we had a good year and we did it the right way.’ I don’t think that conversation’s that hard.”
Anthony went to media day in Denver on Monday and said all the right things. Karl was there, too, and said that he and Anthony had a chance to speak for only about five minutes. But Karl hopes to talk Anthony into staying, for the good of both of them.
“I personally think our first conversation should be man to man, not over the phone,” Karl said on Sept. 17. “I think Melo and I respect one another. He’s a great player. I know he’s made my career very successful because of being a part of his talents, and in 10 days we’re going to have to have that conversation. Melo and I are going to have to go into a room for an hour or two and find out what’s in his heart, and he’s also going to find out what’s in mine.”
The next few days may tell us just what Karl learns about his star player.

A New Twist for Reggie Miller: Visits Knicks, Praises Them
By HOWARD BECK
Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Reggie Miller is now giving a thumbs-up to the Knicks.
No one was more startled to find Reggie Miller – Knicks nemesis, Garden provocateur – on the Knicks’ practice court than Reggie Miller.
“I can’t believe I’m actually in here,” Miller said Sunday afternoon, twitching his head back and forth to make sure he was safe. “I’m thinking Anthony Mason’s going to come over here with a club or something.”
Miller’s Knick-tormenting days are a fading memory, along with the Knicks-Pacers rivalry and meaningful spring games at Madison Square Garden. His visit to the Knicks’ training center was purely professional – he was shooting a segment for his new show, “On the Road with Reggie,” which will air on NBATV.
Strange juxtapositions were everywhere: Donnie Walsh, the former Pacers architect and current Knicks president, at one point sat between Miller (the best pick of Walsh’s career) and Allan Houston, the Knicks’ answer to Miller. Mason was in the gymnasium too, but it was an afternoon of smiles, not snarls.
In fact, Miller gave the Knicks his unflinching endorsement, praising their offseason overhaul and, especially, the acquisition of Amar’e Stoudemire.
“Huge difference,” Miller said after watching the team practice. “It starts with, to me, the new face of the franchise in Amar’e.”
While Stoudemire was a huge presence in Phoenix, the leadership mantle belonged to Steve Nash and Grant Hill. The Knicks, however, are clearly Stoudemire’s team, Miller said.
“He was the first person out here for practice, he led every drill, he finished every drill first,” Miller said. “He stayed later than everyone else shooting. I like it. He was high-fiving everyone during some of the scrimmages. He was getting together and showing guys. There’s some guys that lead by their vocal actions and there’s some guys that lead by just being on the court. And he was doing both. To me, that’s a step in the right direction.”
Although the Knicks’ primary target in July was LeBron James (who signed with Miami), Miller said it was wrong for anyone to view Stoudemire as a consolation prize.
“I would tell them to go back and look at the last 35 games after the All-Star break last year and look at his numbers, and ask who was the best player those last 35 ball games. It was Amar’e Stoudemire,” Miller said. “Look, not everybody can have LeBron, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh. It would have been nice to have a couple of those guys here. But they got a pretty good one and a pretty talented one.
“Donnie’s done a fabulous job of getting some young players in here,” Miller continued. “And how many guys are going to say, `I want to be the face of New York?’ We know how the New York media and the New York fans can be. This is a guy that’s accepting that and embracing that. There’s a lot of guys that like to talk the talk, but they’re scared to walk the walk. Because lets face it, the lights here are the brightest. And if you can perform here, look at Derek Jeter — he accepts that. Look how long it took Randy Johnson — he never accepted that.”
Miller had a chance to join the Knicks in 1996, before they signed Houston. He chose to remain in Indiana, where he played all 18 seasons of his career. As a former small-market star, Miller said he prefers to see the elite players stay with their teams.
“I just like having stars like Kevin Durant in smaller markets,” he said. “I just think it makes for a better product. You can’t have everyone in New York, Chicago, L.A., Miami. I’m glad for LeBron, that’s fabulous. But when you can have guys in Cleveland, Milwaukee, Indiana, San Antonio, Utah, it just makes for a better product when there’s 10 to 15 teams that can actually win it, as opposed to four or five.”
The next superstar to leap to a bigger market will probably be Carmelo Anthony, who is working to force his way out of Denver. Anthony is hoping to land in New York or Chicago.
Miller said Anthony would be a good fit wherever he lands, but added, “Right now, I think it’s a good fit for him in Denver. That’s the team that drafted him. He’s had seven great years there. He’s been an All-Star. I think they’ve been very loyal to him. I’m not saying he’s not being loyal to them. But look, I just like guys starting and finishing their career, lay roots, you know, build a home, do things like that. If things don’t go right, you just don’t want to bail ship, just because things aren’t going right. Those fans, and that owner, has been very supportive of Carmelo. But you guys would like it if he was here, I’m sure.”

N.B.A. Refereeing, There Will Be a Quiz

The N.B.A. announced a crackdown on players complaining about calls at its annual referee camp on Thursday and a marginal increase in instant replay to include its use in clear-path fouls and all of overtime.
(Before, the league used instant replay automatically only during the last two minutes of regulation and the last two minutes of overtime).
The camp also included a test given to media based on controversial situations. The referees are allowed to chide the media for getting answers wrong — their one shot of the year at retribution.
Below are a sample of five questions from the true-or-false test. If you have complained about officiating in the past, go ahead and try it. The league’s referees are graded on a test containing similar material at the end of the camp. (The answers are below).
1) Player A5 legally taps the opening jump ball and player A1 gains possession near the baseline in his backcourt. A shot clock violation occurs when Team A fails to attempt a shot and the horn sounds at 11:34. The game clock MUST be reset to 11:36 (12:00 minus 24 equals 11:36).
2) Player A1 throws an alley-oop pass during a throw-in with 0.2 seconds left on the game clock. Player A5 taps the ball into the basket. The officials will use instant replay to confirm the ball was released prior to 0:00.
3) Defender B1 commits a foul at 1:23 of the 4th quarter and the officials are notified it is his fifth personal foul. At 1:12 , Player B1 is fouled in the act of shooting and the scorer informs the officials that player B1 had in fact, received his sixth foul at 1:23 and not his fifth. This is a correctable error and because it was discovered within 24 seconds, Player B1 will be removed, the game clock reset to 1:23 and the foul at 1:12 will be nullified.
4) Player A6 enters the game prior to Team A’s throw-in. A 20-second timeout is granted when Team A cannot inbound the ball. Players A7 and A8 may replace A5 and A6 prior to the throw-in.
5) Following a successful basket at 3.3 seconds of the quarter, thrower-in A5 rolls the ball up court. The clock incorrectly starts and the official blows the whistle after the ball is picked up near the 28’ mark. The ball should be returned to the baseline and the game clock reset to 3.3.
Answers
1. False. Time can elapse between A5’s tap and when A1 gains possession of the ball.
2. False. There is no instant replay when there is less than .3 seconds on the clock. The only legal play is a tip. An offensive player does not have enough time to gain full possession of the ball.
3. False. The league does not consider this a correctable error. Player B1 would be removed from the game. The elapsed time would count and the player who took his place would shoot his free throws.
4. False. The player has to be involved in some type of basketball play before he can be substituted for.
5. False. The clock will be reset to when the player touched the ball.

Thanking the Canadiens for a Trade to New York
By JEFF Z. KLEIN
¶ “I’m so happy to be here — I want to say thanks to Montreal Canadiens that they traded me to New York Rangers,” says the 22-year-old rookie Pavel Valentenko in the Rangers dressing room after Wednesday night’s 5-1 exhibition-game victory over Detroit at Madison Square Garden. Valentenko, whose previous pro stints were with Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk; Montreal’s A.H.L. farm club in Hamilton; and, most recently, Dinamo Moscow, is one of four defensemen competing for two roster spots on the Rangers’ blue line and has impressed Coach John Tortorella with his poise and hard work. On Thursday he went off doubled over after his first shift (“broke my nose; it’s nothing”), returned to play solid, plus-2 defense — and helped set up this goal by his fellow rookie Derek Stepan on a play that featured wonderful footwork by another Rangers hopeful, the veteran forward Ruslan Fedotenko:
Does Valentenko think he’ll win a roster spot for the Rangers’ opener in Buffalo on Oct. 9? “I don’t think about it now,” he answers. “I just want to do my best, and Coach is going to make his decision.”
¶ Speaking of the Canadiens, what is Rochester native Brian Gionta’s reaction to being named the 28th captain in Habs history, and only the second American captain to hold the honor? “It’s a big thing,” he says. Gionta will wear the “C” tonight in an exhibition game in Montreal versus the Sabres. He succeeds Saku Koivu, who was captain for 10 years, and joins Chris Chelios as one of the two Yanks to wear the letter.
¶ The Edmonton Oilers waive defenseman Sheldon Souray, 34, and goalie Martin Gerber, 36. If the relatively big-name players go unclaimed by noon Friday, they can report to Edmonton’s Oklahoma City farm club. Souray, expensive at $5 million per year, is unlikely to be claimed , but Gerber makes only $500,000 per year.

Boucher Shakes Up Lightning, Roenick Blasts Thrashers, Ovechkin Returns
By STU HACKEL
From Habs Inside/Out:
Two Eastern Conference teams that struggled last year — Tampa Bay and Atlanta — made the most dramatic moves in the offseason and are looking to return to the playoffs and N.H.L. relevance now.
After bringing in Steve Yzerman as general manager, the Lightning struck the Canadiens organization by hiring Guy Boucher as head coach. Boucher’s resume in Hamilton with the Habs’ farm club included a North Division title and a deep run in the Calder Cup playoffs last season, plus kudos from his players and observers for his cerebral coaching techniques. At season’s end, he was won the Lou Pieri Award for American League Coach of the Year.
He previously had been an assistant coach for three Canadian World Junior Championship teams — which won three gold medals — and won the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League regular season once and the Presidents Cup playoff championship twice. This guy can flat out coach and he’s already making an impression in the N.H.L.
In today’s Tampa Tribune, Ira Kaufman writes a short profile of Boucher, the hook being that the coach likes to keep his players off balance and always thinking, a common trait of many successful coaches.
“I hate that word (comfortable),” said Boucher. “You get in your comfort zone and you get in your lazy zone.”

Cup Champion Kozlov Signs With CSKA
By JEFF Z. KLEIN
¶ Slava Kozlov, who won the Stanley Cup with the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 and ‘98, signs with CSKA Moscow of the K.H.L. Kozlov, 38, was not re-signed by Atlanta, where he spent the last seven seasons and compiled 145 of the 356 N.H.L. goals he scored in 1,182 regular-season games dating to 1991-92. Kozlov last played with CSKA, his youth club, during the 1994-95 lockout.
¶ David Frost, the youth hockey coach and player agent barred by the Ontario Hockey Association after being charged with sexual exploitation of minors, is found to be working under an assumed name at a California youth hockey academy . Frost, acquitted of all 12 counts in an Ontario trial in 2008 and also the target of a murder conspiracy by a former client, the ex-N.H.L.’er Mike Danton , is employed in an office job by a hockey school in Laguna Niguel, Calif., under the name Jim McCauley. “I am not coaching, teaching or working with kids,” Frost says, but the school’s strength and conditioning coach has resigned over Frost’s hiring and says Frost was originally hired to run the academy.
¶ The Islanders sign the former Ranger and Devil defenseman Mike Mottau, making him the eighth man to play for all three New York-area teams . Mottau joins Joel Bouchard, Pat Conacher, Mike Dunham, Vladimir Malakhov, Sergei Nemchinov, John Vanbiesbrouck and Kevin Weekes to skate for the Long Island, Manhattan and New Jersey clubs. Footnote: drop the first and last letters from each of the three teams’ nicknames and here’s what you get: slander, anger and evil.
¶ The latest misspelling on the Stanley Cup: Kris Versteeg, which was engraved “Kris Vertseeg” after the Blackhawks won the Cup last spring. Here’s the photographic evidence . The error was corrected. “It’s just a perfect example of my life,” says Versteeg, now with the Leafs. What’s the perfect example? An error? A correction?

Mendes Making a Difference for Red Bulls
By JACK BELL
Red Bulls defender Carlos Mendes has been through so many new beginnings, new eras and new coaches that the meaning of the word “new” has scant significance.
What is new, however, is Mendes’s jersey number — he ceded his No. 4 to Rafael Marquez and now wears No. 44 — and the snowballing power of the Red Bulls, who finished with the worst record in Major League Soccer last season but are evolving into one of the league’s best clubs.
“From the start of the season, the goal was to make the playoffs,” Mendes said Sunday in a telephone interview. “We’re in a good spot right now. We’re improving and starting to gel.”
Mendes, 29, has been paired with the rookie Tim Ream in central defense, starting the last 16 league matches. In a league with a tight salary structure, most teams have been reluctant to pay lavishly for defensive players. (With five years in the league, Mendes is earning a bit more than $90,000 this season.)
Mendes, who has been with the club since 2005, began the season injured, a place where players trying to impress a new coaching staff do not want to be. He played in 12 games in 2009 before the pain in his hip became too much to bear, and he had season-ending surgery to repair a torn labrum.
“I knew I had to get back and prove myself, but I couldn’t do it right away,” Mendes said. “It was tough, and I was anxious to prove myself to the new staff. They were patient.”
That patience on the part of Coach Hans Backe and his staff enabled Mendes to recover physically. Once Mendes  was back training fully, Backe discovered that he  had a keen tactical sense that offered the Red Bulls a unique opportunity to change their style of play.
With the additions of Marquez, Thierry Henry and Mehdi Ballouchy, and the strong play of defenders Chris Albright (until he was injured in last Friday’s 2-0 win at Los Angeles ) and Roy Miller, the Red Bulls have been able to play a three-defender set. In effect, Mendes and Ream stay home on defense while Marquez presses into an attacking five-man midfield.
“L.A. had a huge problem to defend against Márquez and Carlos Mendes and Tim Ream when we built up  from the back with only three players and pushed the two fullbacks,” Red Bulls  Coach Hans Backe told the league’s Web site after the game.
Said Mendes: “When you bring in guys like Marquez and Henry, who have won at the highest level in the world, with their experience and talent, it makes everyone better. What’s impressed me is that they were all brought in for the right reason: to win and help soccer in this country. It’s been a humbling experience and has given us all an excellent opportunity.”
And for a club that has never won an M.L.S. title, that certainly is new.
M.L.S.
Real Salt Lake, the defending league champion, clinched a playoff berth last weekend when New England and Houston were eliminated from postseason contention. D.C. United was eliminated previously. The Red Bulls can clinch a playoff berth in the Eastern Conference with a victory against visiting Kansas City on Saturday. The playoffs begin Oct. 28.
Jeff Cunningham scored last Saturday as F.C. Dallas ran its unbeaten streak to 17 matches with a 3-1 win over Kansas City. Cunningham has 10 goals this season and moved one behind Jaime Moreno,  the league’s career goal-scoring leader with 132. … Colorado’s Conor Casey ended Real Salt Lake’s scoreless streak at 568 minutes, but Nat Borchers tied the game, 2-2, on a header in injury time to extend R.S.L.’s regular-season home unbeaten streak (24 games).
Yanks Abroad
Midfielder Benny Feilhaber has been on a goal-scoring tear for his Danish club, Aarhus GF. He scored in his third straight game Sunday, getting the winning goal in a 3-2 victory over Koge. He also had two assists. Feilhaber has five goals in his last three games and Aarhus, which leads the second-tier division, is unbeaten in its last five. … In Germany, Michael Bradley scored at the end of the first half as Borussia Mönchengladbach built a 2-0 lead but  settled for a 2-2 tie against struggling Schalke. … In Mexico, Herculez Gomez made good use of his 13 minutes in the match, scoring an insurance goal in Pachuca’s 3-1 win over Tecos. In England, Stuart Holden went the full 90 minutes in Bolton’s 2-2 tie against Manchester United. … In a battle of teams with American goalkeepers, Brad Friedel’s Aston Villa got the better of Marcus Hahnemann and Wolverhampton, 2-1.

¶Top UEFA Champions League matches this week include Tottenham’s hosting Twente, and the Spanish league leader Valencia’s hosting Manchester United. Both games are Wednesday.

Submit Your Questions for A.C. Milan’s Clarence Seedorf
Clarence Seedorf returns to the Goal blog this week for his first Q&A session of the new European soccer season. He last answered Times readers’ questions in May , so there is a lot to discuss, to say the least.
Matteo Bazzi/European Pressphoto Agency
Clarence Seedorf
Since making his professional debut for Ajax of Amsterdam at age 16, Seedorf has become one of Europe’s most decorated soccer players . Seedorf has won the UEFA Champions League four times with three different teams. Seedorf is an integral player for A.C. Milan and an increasingly active member of the international soccer community.
In 2007, Seedorf started ON International , a sports management business. And he is pursuing a master’s degree in business at Bocconi University in Milan. Seedorf is also the founder of Champions for Children , a nonprofit foundation dedicated to supporting young people in developing countries. Last June, as a result of his philanthropic work, he was named a Legacy Champion by the Nelson Mandela Foundation .
Seedorf’s club A.C. Milan has gotten off to a somewhat choppy start to its Serie A campaign under a new coach, Massimiliano Allegri. After five games, the team sits in fifth place.
On Saturday, Milan earned an important 1-0 win at home against Genoa, thanks to a spectacular goal from Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who signed with the club this summer.
The club’s other big summer signing, Brazilian midfielder Robinho, started for the first time and combined with Seedorf for a fine sequence of passes in the 81st minute that nearly produced a second goal for Milan.
Last week, Rob Hughes wrote in the Times about the challenge Allegri faces integrating these new players with Milan’s other stars , young and old, like Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato, Filippo Inzaghi and Seedorf.
The project is ongoing, but in the meantime, the big games keep coming.
Tomorrow, Seedorf and Milan shift their focus to Amsterdam, where they will face the Dutch club Ajax for a Champions League group stage match.
The game is a significant one for Seedorf, who started his career with Ajax in 1992, at the age of 16, and played there for three seasons, before moving on to bigger clubs in Italy and Spain.
“I will continue to play for a couple more years, but this could very well be my last match in Amsterdam,” Seedorf said last week . “It’s a very special feeling for me to return to Ajax for Wednesday’s game, and I hope the feelings are mutual.”
Now is your chance to ask Seedorf about these topics or any others you have in mind.
Submit your questions in the comments section below and check back later this week for his responses.

Red Bulls Are for Real
By JACK BELL
Hans Backe is a forthright kind of guy. He is normally careful with his words, like most coaches in professional sports, but Backe, who is from Sweden, also has a loquacious streak that has helped him earn points in his first season with the Red Bulls of Major League Soccer.
And before Friday night’s 2-0 win against the Los Angeles Galaxy in Carson, Calif., Backe would tell anyone who would ask that no, his team was not quite ready to challenge for the league title just yet, thank you. Perhaps next year.
Now, next year could come as early as November if the club keeps growing and keeps winning, as it has done since the acquisition of Thierry Henry, Rafael Marquez and now Mehdi Ballouchy. The club has reached deep into the pockets of its deep-pocketed energy-drink owners to sign international stars, but in many ways it has been the largely unsung role players — like Tim Ream, Dane Richards, Carlos Mendes and Chris Albright — who have made such a huge difference.
Here are some of Backe’s comments from the Red Bulls after the game against the Galaxy:
On the game in general:
“It is a massive on the road win for us, of course. We deserved this victory I would say. The first half, after the first three or four minutes, we controlled the game. Our buildup was excellent, the passing game, the possession. L.A. had huge problems to defend against Marquez, Carlos Mendes and Tim Ream when we would build up from the back four with three players and push the full backs. In the second half, they got some chances, but I would say it was one of the best performances so far from this team.”
On the play of Ballouchy:
“Man of the match. Absolutely outstanding. I’m surprised that he is that good. He is all over the pitch. His passing game, he is so composed on the ball, wants the ball all of the time, gets our game going, set up strikers and wide players. He was definitely the man of the match.”
On the play of Marquez:
“It was good. We decided at halftime to play him maximum 65 minutes because he has been fatigued and he is still fatigued and we didn’t want to take any risks with picking up a stupid injury at this stage in the season. He was the guy at the beginning of the first half that started our buildup. He is so precise in the passing game.”
On the result:
“I think the last five or six weeks we have looked very consistent and strong, defending very well. Everyone has been ready to do the dirty work in these games, even the strikers. So I’m not really that surprised. I’m surprised of course to win away against the best team in M.L.S. When everything works like it did today, the shape and the right attitude, you can win games like this.”
Pending the outcome of Saturday’s New England-Columbus game, the Red Bulls are in first place in the Eastern Conference (on goal differential) over the Crew with four games left in the regular season.

62;"Tour de France
(CNN) -- Reigning Tour de France champion Alberto Contador has rejected the findings of a positive dope test taken while the cyclist was competing in this year's race, blaming it on bad meat.
Contador was provisionally suspended from competitive cycling by the sport's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), on Thursday following the results of the test.
The Spanish rider, a three-time winner of cycling's showpiece event, had traces of the banned substance clenbuterol in a test sample he gave on July 21 -- which was a rest day.
However, in a press conference held in the 27-year-old's home town of Pinto in Spain, which CNN attended, Contador said he was innocent.
Tour of Spain runner-up fails doping test
""It is a food contamination case of which I am the victim."" He added that the test result was due to bad meat he and several other riders had eaten the day before the test.
""When they confirmed to me what had happened the first thing I did was ask the UCI which of my fellow riders had passed the test.
""They said the only one who passed the control ... was Alexandre Vinokourov. [He was the only one of the riders] who did not eat the meat on that day."" He concluded that truth was on his side.
Contador now faces a fight to clear his name after the UCI released a statement saying: ""The UCI confirmed today that Spanish rider Alberto Contador returned an adverse analytical finding for clenbuterol.
Video: Contador rejects test
Video: Contador could be right
The UCI confirmed today that Spanish rider Alberto Contador returned an adverse analytical finding for clenbuterol.
--UCI Statement
""The rider, who had already put an end to his cycling season before the result was known, was nevertheless formally and provisionally suspended as is prescribed by the World Anti-Doping Code.
""This result was reported by the WADA accredited laboratory in Cologne to UCI and WADA simultaneously.""
The UCI went on to explain the amounts of the prohibited stimulant found in the sample were low, so a second sample was also tested.
""In view of this very small concentration and in consultation with WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), the UCI immediately had the proper results management proceedings conducted including the analysis of B sample that confirmed the first result.""
Further analysis of the results will now be carried out by UCI and WADA, with no further comment being made until it has been concluded.
""The UCI continues working with the scientific support of WADA to analyze all the elements that are relevant to the case.
""In order to protect the integrity of the proceedings and in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code, the UCI will refrain from making any further comments until the management of this adverse analytical finding has been completed.""
Andy Schleck, who finished runner-up to Contador in this year's Tour De France, said he hoped the Spaniard would prove his innocence.
""I hope he is innocent and I think he deserves the right to defend himself now,"" Schleck wrote on the micro-blogging site Twitter. ""What a crazy day in cycling with the news about Contador. I only heard about it in the press.""
Cadel Evans, who finished second to Contador in the 2007 edition, said he wanted to find out the facts of the case before passing judgment.
''I just read some little things in the paper, I don't really know what the situation is. [But] if people are cheating and getting caught, that's a good thing. If people want to exaggerate the stories and ... claim cycling is a filthy sport, that's not such a good thing.
""I don't know exactly what the situation is, they're still waiting on further analysis. I'd like to see what facts come about Contador before I make an opinion.''
Daniel Friebe, features editor of Pro Cycling magazine, believes it is possible the Spaniard could have received the substance in food, and this case is not comparable to other doping scandals in cycling.
Friebe told CNN: ""This really does sound like a legitimate excuse.
""It's well known that clenbuterol is used on cattle. This is an alibi that's been used before and it's been verified before. It doesn't sound impossible to me.""
He said that people familiar with other incidents of doping in the sport will recognize that Contador has been unlucky.
Most people who are au fait with how doping within cycling works will be fairly sure that this is quite different to other cases
--Daniel Friebe, Pro Cycling magazine
""Most people who are au fait with how doping within cycling works will be fairly sure that this is quite different to other cases,"" he said.
Friebe also explained how taking clenbuterol would not make sense for Contador and it could possibly have a negative effect on his performance.
""He is well known for his climbing ability. This substance is a steroid, which will boost muscle mass and make him heavier. It's not really the kind of substance you would expect a rider like him to take.""
Contador, who has just signed a contract with the Saxo Bank team, successfully defended his Tour title while riding for the Kazakhstan-based Astana team.
The Spaniard won his first Tour in 2007 and joined Astana in 2008 -- although he was prevented from defending his title that year as the team had been banned by race organizers for previous doping violations.
In 2006, Contador was linked to a Spain-based blood-doping ring known as ""Operation Puerto"" but was cleared of any wrongdoing.
The only previous winner of the Tour de France to be stripped of his title after being found guilty of using a banned substance was Floyd Landis.
The American was found to have taken testosterone while winning the 2006 race.

63;"Alberto Contador
(CNN) -- Tour of Spain runner-up Ezequiel Mosquera and his Xacobeo team-mate David Garcia Da Pena have tested positive for banned substances during the race, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) revealed on Thursday.
The Spanish duo both returned urine samples containing hydroxyethyl starch, a plasma substitute that has the potential to increase blood volume and boost oxygen delivery to the body.
Mosquera and Garcia Da Pena's samples, collected following the September 16 stage of the Tour of Spain, were tested at a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited laboratory in Cologne.
Both riders have the right to request that their B samples are tested.
Mosquera went on to finish second behind Italian Vincenzo Nibali in the race earlier this month.
The news came on the same day that Tour de France champion Alberto Contador's positive test for banned drug clenbutrerol was revealed.
The Spaniard has protested his innocence, claiming the substance entered his body through contaminated meat.

64;"Tottenham Hotspur FC
(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o netted a superb hat-trick to help holders Inter Milan thrash Werder Bremen 4-0 in Champions League Group A.
The Cameroon striker opened the scoring in the 21st minute when he slipped the ball under goalkeeper Tim Wiese after Esteban Cambiasso robbed the ball off Daniel Jensen.
Eto'o added his second when converting a lofted pass from Lucio and completed his treble nine minutes from time when out-pacing the Werder defence after latching onto Wes Sneijder's pass, and rounding Wiese.
And Eto'o also had a hand in the goal that put Inter 3-0 ahead, with his pinpoint pass finding Sneijder -- and the Dutchman fired into the top corner.
Inter are level on four points with Tottenham at the top of the table, after the London club beat Dutch champions FC Twente 4-1 in a remarkable match that saw Spurs awarded three penalties and also have Rafael van der Vaart sent off after collecting two yellow cards.
Van der Vaart wasted a chance to put the hosts ahead when goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov saved his spot-kick after Peter Wisgerhof fouled Peter Crouch in the area.
But Van der Vaart made amends soon after the break when converting on the turn a Crouch knock-down.
Spurs soon made it 2-0 when Roman Pavlyuchenko scored from the penalty spot after a foul on Gareth Bale.
Twente pulled a goal back through substitute Nacer Chadli before van der Vaart was given his marching orders for lunging in on Roberto Rosales.
But Tottenham restored their two-goal advantage when Pavlyuchenko netted another spot-kick after a handball in the area and Bale added a late fourth to put the icing on the cake.
Meanwhile, in Group B, French giants Lyon -- who are trailing in 18th place in their domestic league after just one victory all season -- claimed a morale- boosting 3-1 win at Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv.
Michel Bastos scored twice with Miralem Pjanic also on target as Lyon top the table with a maximum six points.
Schalke are second in the table after Jefferson Farfan and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar earned the German side a 2-0 win over Benfica in the other group match.

(CNN) -- A second-half penalty from David Villa proved enough to earn Barcelona a 1-1 draw at Rubin Kazan in Group D of the Champions League on Wednesday.
The Spanish international striker scored from the spot on the hour mark after Andres Iniesta was fouled by Lasha Salukvadze in the penalty  area.
Russian champions Rubin had themselves taken the lead from the penalty spot after half-an-hour, when Ecuadorian midfielder Christian Noboa lashed the ball past Victor Valdes after Daniel Alves was adjudged to have fouled Vitaly Kaleshin.
With Lionel Messi back in the side after recovering from an ankle injury, the Spanish champions pressed for a winning goal and the Argentine nearly provided it, only for goalkeeper Sergei Ryzhikov to block his 71st minute shot.
However, it was the hosts who nearly snatched all three points late on when Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins hit the post with a close-range header.
Meanwhile, in the other Group D match, Danish champions Copenhagen claimed a superb 2-0 win at Panathinaikos, courtesy of goals from Martin Vingaard and Dame N'Doye, to lead the table with a maximum six points from their two matches.
Barcelona are second on four points while Greek side Panathinaikos, who played most of the second half with 10 men following the dismissal of Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva, are bottom of the group having lost both of their matches.
Meanwhile, in Group C, British sides Manchester United and Rangers both claimed vital 1-0 wins on Wednesday to lead the table with four points apiece.
United came away from the Mestalla in Valencia with a superb late win courtesy of a breakaway goal from Mexican international striker Javier Fernandez.
Meanwhile, in Glasgow, Steven Naismith sidefooted home a header from Kirk Broadfoot to see off Turkish side Bursaspor, who are bottom of the table with no points from their two matches.

(CNN) -- Real Madrid took a giant stride towards the knockout stage of the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Auxerre for their second straight win in the tough Group G on Tuesday night.
A late goal from substitute Angel di Maria sealed the points for Jose Mourinho's men who beat Ajax Amsterdam 2-0 in the Bernabeu in their group opener.
The visitors had dominated the game and created a series of chances, but  looked set for another goalless draw until di Maria struck with nine minutes left.
The Argentine winger controlled a right-wing cross on his chest before volleying home.
Auxerre had offered precious little in attack but moments before Real defender Pepe's header struck his own post and bounced clear.
The win leaves them with six points from two games, two clear of AC Milan, who drew 1-1 with Ajax in the other match played Tuesday in a group of three teams with illustrious records in the competition.
Former Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic dealt his old side a blow with Milan's equalizer -- his third in the tournament having scored twice in the opening 2-0 win over Auxerre.
The Swede combined with Clarence Seedorf to pull them level in the 37th minute.
Ajax had gone ahead in the 23rd minute, with Uruguay international Luis Suarez playing a vital part as he foxed Alessandro Nesta before sending a low cross for Moroccan international Mounir El Hamdaoui to score past past Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati.

Arsenal scored a thrilling 3-1 victory at 10-man Partizan Belgrade, while Ukrainian side Shakhtar were equally convincing 3-0 winners against Braga.
Arsene Wenger's Arsenal were coming off a shock 3-2 defeat to West Brom in the English Premier League on Saturday but survived some scares for a comfortable win.
Man of the match Jack Wilshere brilliantly set up Andrey Arshavin to give them a 15th minute but Partizan draw level against the run of play through Brazil-born striker Cleo from the spot.
Partizan Marko Jovanovic lost early in the second-half as he conceded a penalty but Arshavin saw his penalty saved by goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic before striker Marouane Chamakh put them ahead again on 71 minutes.
Sebastien Squillaci nodded home substitute Samir Nasri's corner to make it 3-1 in the 82nd minute before the underfire Lukasz Fabianski dived to his right to save Cleo's late penalty for Partizan.
Shakhtar's Brazilian stars Douglas Costa and Luiz Adriano were key to their win as Braga, thrashed 6-0 at Arsenal in the first match, lost heavily on their home ground.
Costa set up his teammate and compatriot for the first two goals and added the third from the spot in the last minute when converted after Paulo Cesar had fouled Willian in the area.

England's world triple jump champion Phillips Idowu also pulled out last week, worried about security and hygiene issues which have dogged organizers.
Jamaica's Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man, said earlier this year that he would not be going to the Games, robbing them of a star attraction.
They are due to start on Sunday, with most teams having now arrived in India, despite the unfavorable reports.

""Whatever is said within that team room stays within that team room,"" Montgomerie told gathered reporters.
""I thought I was the captain of a golf team, not the captain of a tweeting organization,"" he added.
Montgomerie was quick to try to move the questioning around to golfing matters and just as quick to highlight the practice form of his controversial selection Padraig Harrington, who was picked ahead of Paul Casey.
The Irishman reeled off a string of birdies and eagles, Montgomerie revealed:
""He's playing the best golf of my team out there, and I feel the criticism early on before the Ryder Cup is very unjustified.
""He's a world class player. He's won three major championships, and the stature of the guy is second to none within our team.""
Meanwhile, Tiger Woods, one of U.S. captain Corey Pavin's four picks, told reporters that he was putting the team first in his first Ryder Cup for four years after missing the Valhalla triumph in 2008 through injury.
""It would be great to get a win and I'm looking forward to getting out there and contributing and hopefully getting some points,"" Woods said.
""It's just so neat to be a part of a team and quite frankly, we don't get to do it very often.""
Woods sidestepped questions about his private life after his divorce from Elin Nordegren and any suggestion he was being snubbed by the wives and girlfriends of his teammates.
""No, we are here as a team. We're here to win the Ryder Cup.""
Pavin is confident his team will be able to cope with the partisan home galleries when the match starts for real on Friday.
""The rookies will be prepared because we've talked about it,"" Pavin said. ""But I don't see a situation happening out there that the people will applaud for bad shots or missed putts.""

72;"John Sudworth BBC News, Seoul
Finally, then, a glimpse of the future face of North Korea.
It's a somewhat pudgy one, showing as we'd expect a young man much better fed than the overwhelming majority of his fellow countrymen.
Kim Jong-un's remarkable, rapid promotion this week to senior military and political office has already been reported - his first ever mention by name - in North Korea's government-controlled press.
But his special family connection has not been made clear.  Now, for your average North Korean poring over the group photograph of the assembled officials, the symbolism won't need to be explained.
Kim Jong-un's front-row proximity to his father, as well as the clear family likeness, makes it all too clear.
Here is the chosen successor, with for good measure, the backing of the military, represented by a stern-faced officer in the middle.
Kim Jong-un's remarkable rise
The official photograph was published on the front page of a state-controlled North Korean newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun.
It showed 200 officials at the Workers' Party convention. Seated in the front row, just two seats along from his father, is Kim Jong-un.
Although the caption did not identify him, state media reported that he had attended the photo session.
Previously only grainy images from his childhood have been seen in the West.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says the family likeness is clear, and North Koreans, seeing the photo for the first time, are unlikely to miss the significance.
Kim Jong-un is Kim Jong-il's third son and had already been identified as the most likely successor to the Communist dynasty started by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, in 1948.
Our correspondent says his rise is remarkable, even by the standards of one of the world's most totalitarian states.
He says there can now be little doubt that Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un has been chosen to eventually take over from his ailing father, who is thought to have had a stroke in 2008.
The few still photographs released from the conference hall show Kim Jong-il apparently chairing proceedings.
Analysts say that, at least, confirms that, although thin and frail, he is well enough to attend and seemingly still in control.

The three Japanese nationals released on Thursday admitted to violating Chinese law, Xinhua news agency said.
Japan's media identified the fourth man as 57-year-old Sadamu Takahashi.
A government spokesman said it was not clear why the men had been detained and that China had been asked for a detailed account of the incident.
The BBC's Martin Patience, in Beijing, says the release should help ease tensions between China and Japan.
Tensions have been high since Japan detained a Chinese captain, who Japanese prosecutors suspected may have rammed the patrol ships deliberately.
The trawler was sailing in an area claimed by both countries, near uninhabited islands which may have rich oil and gas deposits.
The captain was released after two weeks. China has demanded a formal apology. Japan has refused, instead insisting that China must pay damages to cover the repair of its two patrol vessels.

""Using the [yuan] exchange rate issue as an excuse to engage in trade protectionism against China can only harm China-US trade and economic relations, and will have a negative effect on both countries' economies and the world economy,"" warned spokeswoman Jiang Yu, speaking at a regular press briefing.
She also urged US congressmen to ""resist protectionism"".
Trade rules
If it becomes law, the bill will allow the US Commerce Department to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, if it deems the yuan to be ""fundamentally undervalued"".
Those tariffs would also need the approval of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
But speaking to China's state-run news agency, Yao Jian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, said US attempts to use the exchange rate to justify trade restrictions would violate WTO rules.
He also warned that the US had as much to lose from a trade war as China, with China is now the US's fastest-growing export market.
The Chinese government also argues that its trade surplus with the US does not demonstrate that the current yuan-dollar exchange rate gives it an unfair advantage, pointing out that it has similar trade surpluses with other Asian countries.
Even if the bill is not finally approved, it is likely to increase pressure on both the US and China to resolve the long-running disagreement over the yuan.
On Wednesday, China's central bank promised to increase flexibility in the exchange rate, three months after ending its policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar.
But there has been frustration among business groups and politicians in the US that the yuan has risen by only 2% in that time.
Analysts estimate the yuan is currently undervalued by up to 25% against the US dollar.

Nintendo shares dive as 3DS delay hits profits
Nintendo was relying on the 3DS for a big chunk of its profits in the crucial Christmas season
Shares in games company Nintendo have sunk after the firm more than halved its profit forecast because of delays to its new 3DS console.
Nintendo has admitted that its 3DS machine, which features 3D technology, will not be ready to go on sale during the crucial Christmas season.
It cut its profit forecast for the year to March 2011 to 90bn yen ($1.1bn; £681m) from 200bn yen.
In Tokyo, shares in Nintendo closed down 9.3%.
The 3DS will now go on sale in Japan in February, and reach shops in Europe and the US in March.
Nintendo also said the strong yen had also hurt profits, along with a lack of hit titles for its existing DS and Wii consoles.
However, the delay to the 3DS is the most significant factor in the revision to the profit forecasts, with the games console market heavily reliant on the Christmas season.

76;"A puppet dictator?
Pak Kil-yon told the UN General Assembly in New York that the warheads would not be abandoned as long as US aircraft-carriers ""sailed around the seas"" of North Korea.
The US and South Korea have held a series of joint military exercises since the Cheonan incident, prompting the North to threaten to retaliate.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says that the talks ending without progress is not a surprise given the large number of thorny and intractable issues between the two sides.
Flood aid
Before Thursday's talks in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the South Korean defence ministry said the North had wanted to discuss their disputed maritime borders and anti-North Korean leafletting by activists.
It responded by saying the agenda should also include the North's alleged responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan, officials said.
The sinking of the Cheonan sharply worsened inter-Korean ties
Inter-Korean military talks were last held in October 2008.
In recent weeks there have been signs of improvement between the two sides, with the South announcing it would send aid to its neighbour, which has been hit by severe flooding.
The North meanwhile returned a detained Southern fishing boat and its seven crew, and proposed a resumption of reunions for separated families.
Meanwhile, the youngest son of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, was on Wednesday given two top-level jobs in the ruling Workers' Party, following his elevation to the military rank of general.
Correspondents say it is another sign that Kim Jong-un, who has never held any public position, is being lined up to succeed his father.

77;"Buffett gives charities $1.93bn
Mr Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, dismissed rumours that some wealthy Chinese business people had been reluctant to meet him and Warren Buffett.
He said two out of three people invited had turned up to the dinner, which was held in a replica French-style castle in Beijing.
Mr Gates said he had heard some interesting ideas, but he said that China's economic reforms had only recently started to produce rich people - and many of them were still unsure about what to do with their money.
Inspired debate
It was unclear if anyone pledged to donate money at the Beijing dinner, says the BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing.
Mr Buffett, the chairman of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, said he had come to China to hear about philanthropy in the country and not to ask people to give.
""No-one was asked in anyway, either indirectly or directly, to sign up to anything last night,"" he said.
""This is a key generation for new China. Today's generation of successful entrepreneurs has the chance to lead and inspire giving for generations to come,"" he said.
The state-run Global Times said the guest list of 50 of China's super-rich included Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, the CEO of property developer SOHO China, and Niu Gensheng, founder of Mengniu Dairy.
Another of those attending was Chen Guangbiao - a multi-millionaire who made his money by recycling waste material from the construction industry.
He told the BBC that he had already decided to leave all his money to charity when he dies.
""Giving and helping has been part of Chinese culture for 5,000 years. But charity has only really developed in China over the last 30 years, since we introduced economic reforms.
""People have only just started to get rich and we've only recently been able to feed ourselves,"" he says.
Our correspondent says that handing over money to good causes is not as well established in China as in some other countries.
If this dinner has achieved anything, it has been to inspire debate about what it means to give to charity, he says.

The US is Taiwan's biggest ally and is obliged by the Taiwan Relations Act to help in the island's defence. In February, it said the weapons sale contributed to ""security and stability"" between Taiwan and China.
The two sides have now agreed that dialogue ""is essential to build mutual trust and reduce the chances of misunderstanding and miscalculation"", according to Colonel Dave Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman.
Ties between Washington and Beijing have also been strained this year over internet policy, Tibet, the US trade deficit, and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.

The state-run Bernama news agency reported that the couple, from Gemas, south-east of Kuala Lumpur, were the first couple to be charged under a law banning intentionally abandoning a child below the age of 12.
The agency reported that the teenage mother cried in court, asking to be spared detention as she was still breastfeeding the baby.
About 100 babies are found abandoned each year in Malaysia - many of them dead.
Analysts believe many of the infants are abandoned by single mothers, scared of being shunned in a country where sex before marriage is considered taboo.

Things are looking up for Japanese manufacturers, though the longer-term outlook remains gloomy
Japanese business confidence has continued to rise, despite the strong yen, but is expected to turn gloomy.
The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey rose to a marginally positive 8 from 1 in June. A reading of zero is neutral.
But the big manufacturers questioned said they expected confidence to fall back to -1 by the end of the year.
Japanese exporters have been hurt by the strong yen, which has fallen below 84 to the dollar again, despite government intervention to weaken it.
The dollar buys fewer yen as the Japanese currency strengthens.
The Tankan survey of 11,000 companies is carried out every quarter by Japan's central bank.
The survey, which reports the percentage of optimistic firms minus the percentage of pessimistic ones, hit a record low of -58 in early 2009, but has steadily recovered since then.
But manufacturers now expect the reading to fall back into negative territory by December, thanks to the strong yen, while company investment plans were weaker than previously forecast.
The Nikkei stock market index initially jumped 0.6% on the stronger-than-expected survey result, before falling back again in late morning trading.

Eighteen Burmese refugees have arrived in Japan from Thailand, marking a new turn in Japan's asylum policy.
It follows Japan's agreement to accept about 90 Burmese under a third country resettlement plan promoted by the UN.
The three ethnic minority Karen families have been living for 10 years in a camp in north-western Thailand after fleeing persecution in Burma.
Japan has been criticised in the past for allowing in far fewer refugees than other wealthy nations.
Integration
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says the refugees arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport wearing jackets against the autumn chill.
Japan says it is the first Asian country to take part in the UN-backed resettlement programme.
Japan is one of the world's most generous donors to refugees overseas, but gives scant welcome to asylum seekers at home, our correspondent says.
Last year just 30 people were granted refugee status. Another 501 received special residence permits on humanitarian grounds, but with fewer rights.
The Burmese refugees are expected to spend the next six months in Tokyo learning Japanese.
The government says if they integrate well into society it may consider allowing more refugees into the country.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
Presenter Sarah Murdoch: ""I don't know what to say right now, I'm feeling a bit sick about this""
TV show Australia's Next Top Model has announced the wrong winner during the live final of its sixth series.
Kelsey Martinovich had been crowned champion by public vote and was making an acceptance speech when presenter Sarah Murdoch interrupted her.
Shaking her head and listening to her earpiece, Murdoch said: ""I'm feeling sick about this. I'm so sorry, this was a complete accident.""
Kelsey Martinovich (left) was crowned winner when Amanda Ware (right) had actually won
She then announced the real winner was 18-year-old Amanda Ware.
""This is what happens when you have live TV, folks,"" she said. ""This is insane, insane, insane.""
Martinovich, who had been under the impression she was a winner for about a minute, appeared to take the news well, saying, ""It's OK, it's an honest mistake,"" as Murdoch asked: ""How could this happen?""
She attempted to explain the gaffe, saying: ""The lead kept changing. It was literally down to a couple of votes. It kept going back and forwards... and we ended up with Amanda as a winner.""
The two contestants embraced, before Ware gave a shocked ""Thanks"" to her supporters and walked the catwalk for the final time.
Fox said Martinovich was awarded AUS$25,000 (£15,162) and a free trip to the US by way of apology.
Ware won an eight-page spread in women's magazine Harpers Bazaar, a contract with Priscilla's modelling agency, an AUS$25,000 Levi's campaign, an AUS$20,000 (£12,130) cash prize, a new car and a trip to New York.
Spin-offs
Amanda Ware had found herself in the ""bottom two"" contestants in the show's penultimate week
The show, shown in Australia on Tuesday evening, was broadcast with a live studio audience on the Fox8 pay TV channel, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
Sarah Murdoch, a fashion model and TV presenter, is married to Rupert's son Lachlan.
She replaced Jodhi Meares as host of Australia's Next Top Model last year, after Meares blundered her way through the show's 2007 final, and pulled out of the 2008 broadcast with just 48 hours' notice.
Meares later told Grazia magazine she had never agreed to present a live show, adding: ""I don't aspire to handle crowds of that level.""
The hugely popular Next Top Model shows, created by supermodel Tyra Banks in the US, pit aspiring models against each other.
Each week, they compete for judges in a variety of photo shoots to stay in the competition, with the eventual winner receiving a cash prize and modelling contract.
There are several dozen spin-offs, including series in the UK, Brazil, China, Finland and Israel.

The southern right whale migrates along Australia's coasts
Australian officials are investigating reports of a teenage boy riding on the back of a whale.
A witness has told authorities that he saw the youngster climb on to a southern right whale near the town of Albany in Western Australia on Friday.
Harassing wildlife is an offence which carries a maximum penalty of A$10,000 (US$9,600).
Conservation authorities say such a stunt would be ""foolhardy and reckless"".

Disturbance or physical contact... not only distresses the whales but also could result in a tragic outcome ”
End Quote Mike Shephard Department of Environment and Conservation
Mike Shephard from the local Department of Environment and Conservation said: ""If you are in the way of a tail slap or when it breaches you are unlikely to survive.""
Southern right whales can reach 18m in length and weigh up to 80 tonnes.
In a statement, Mr Shephard said these whales came close to shore to rest and to allow calves to gain strength in calm waters.
""Disturbance or physical contact with them, either deliberate or accidental, not only distresses the whales but also could result in a tragic outcome for a foolhardy person,"" he said.
Under Western Australian laws, boats must stay at least 100m away from whales while swimmers and surfers must be at a minimum distance of 30m.
The BBC's Phil Mercer says the legislation is meant to keep people away from migrating pods along Australia's east and west coasts.
On Monday, wildlife officers were seen patrolling Albany's beaches to remind people to keep their distance from the whales.

Prime Minister Wen met US President Barack Obama in New York on Thursday.
However both men steered clear of a row over Beijing's currency policy, with President Obama saying that US-China cooperation had helped ease global financial turmoil.
Currency bill
In a speech on the sidelines of a United Nations global summit, Mr Wen said ""the conditions for a major appreciation of the renminbi [yuan] do not exist.""
""The main reason for the US trade deficit with China is not the renminbi exchange rate, but the structure of trade and investment between the two countries.""
A House of Representatives committee is set to vote on Friday on a China currency bill that would punish China if it does not do more to let the yuan rise.
The full House is expected to vote on it next week, according to a Democratic aide.
""It is time for Congress to pass legislation that will give the administration leverage in its bilateral and multilateral negotiations with the Chinese government,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday.
Earlier this week, President Obama said China's currency was ""valued lower than market conditions would say it should be"".
""So it gives them an advantage in trade. We are going to continue to insist that on this issue, and on all trade issues between us and China, that it's a two-way street.""
Trade disputes
Currency is not the only point of tension between China and the US.
Beijing has also warned the US not to interfere in a territorial dispute over claims to the South China Sea, while China is also angry over US arms sales to its rival Taiwan.
But Mr Wen said: ""I fully believe that all the disputes and friction in China-US trade at the moment can be resolved.""
He added that China wanted a ""strong and stable US, just as the US needs a strong, stable China"".

85;"Q&A: What's moving the yen?
Currency strategists suggested this was a sign of the move's initial success, but cautioned about making early judgements.
Japan did not reveal the size of the intervention, but analysts suggested its authorities could have sold as much as 1 trillion yen ($11bn; £7.5bn), one of the largest amounts it has spent in a single day.
Investors welcomed the intervention, sending Japan's Nikkei share index up by 2.9% at first, with the index eventually closing 2.3% higher at 9,516.56.
The yen had spiked after news filtered through that Prime Minister Naoto Kan had survived a leadership challenge from rival Ichiro Ozawa.
Traders had reckoned Mr Kan would be less likely than Mr Ozawa to take measures to weaken the yen.

But in a brief news conference, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said: ""We have conducted an intervention in order to suppress excessive fluctuations in the currency market.
""We will closely monitor currency developments, and take firm action including intervention.
""Our country's economy is still in a very severe situation with continued deflation,"" he added.
The yen's rapid appreciation ""harms the stability of the economy and finances. We cannot tolerate it.""
Japanese exporters praised the intervention.
""From the standpoint of aiding the competitiveness of Japan's manufacturing industry, we applaud the move by the government and the Bank of Japan to correct the yen's strength,"" carmaker Honda said in a statement.
Honda's shares closed up 4%, while Sony, another big exporter, ended 4.2% higher.
Toyota has estimated that every one-yen rise versus the dollar reduces earnings by about 30bn yen.
A recent government survey suggested many companies were considering moving production overseas if the yen stayed high.
Lasting effect?
Despite broad support for the intervention, there were doubts about its lasting impact without action by other central banks.
""The effect from Japan's solo intervention won't last very long. We have to see how the US and European monetary authorities react,"" said Yuji Kameoka, chief forex strategist at Daiwa Institute.
When asked about the currency intervention, Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup said: ""Unilateral actions are not the appropriate way to deal with global imbalances.""
Others also stressed the importance of support from Japan's fellow G7 members, as Japan's last major intervention into the markets in 2004 met with critical comments from the then-US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
If repeated, currency strategist Simon Derrick said, ""not only would this prove embarrassing, such criticism would run the risk of also undoing the work that they had already done"".

And China's purchasing manager's index, or PMI, has revealed its first gain in four months.
China's growth raised hopes that it will increase consumption of US exports, and help sustain America's economic recovery.
In America, the Institute said that its manufacturing index rose to 56.3 in August, up from 55.5 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates growth.
US factories have seen rising demand for exports and also from businesses that are renewing capital equipment and re-building stocks.
Meanwhile, China's PMI, which measures manufacturing growth, rose to 51.7 in August from 51.2 in July.
A separate HSBC survey also showed a rise, reaching a three-month high of 51.9 in August from 49.4 in July. Anything above 50 shows an expansion.
The data from the US and China helped lifted stock markets, with the Dow Jones closing 2.54% higher and London's FTSE 100 2.7% better.
However, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell despite the positive news.
The market fell 15.92 points, or 0.6%, closing at 2,622.88.
Commentators have suggested the drop was caused by continuing concerns about slowing Chinese economic growth in the long term.

87;"Australia seek new bowling coach ahead of Ashes series
Cooley has been involved in winning Ashes campaigns for both sides
Australia could be without a specialist bowling coach when the Ashes starts in November after farming out Troy Cooley to their Centre of Excellence.
Cooley, one of the masterminds behind England's 2005 Ashes success, defected to his native Australia to help Ricky Ponting's men to the 2006-07 whitewash.
He remained Australia's bowling coach when England won the Ashes in 2009.
But he now takes Greg Chappell's role to head up the Brisbane facility that has replaced the Australia academy.
Chappell, the former Australian captain, has moved to the newly-created role of national talent manager, based in Melbourne.
Cricket Australia's acting chief executive Michael Brown said: ""Troy will continue to support the Australian team throughout the Ashes Test series and the World Cup campaign.""
606: DEBATE
I've been wondering if what happens in the India v Australia Tests has any bearing on the Ashes series
HopeForTheBest
But a CA statement also suggested it might need someone to take over his day-to-day position before the first Ashes Test begins on 25 November.
It read: ""CA will be working to replace Troy as pace-bowling coach as soon as practicable after further discussions with [head coach] Tim Nielsen and an assessment of current needs in this area.""
Cooley, 44, made his name during the 2005 Ashes campaign, when he was credited with helping Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones master reverse swing and confound the Australian batsmen.
The following year he was snapped up by the Australians after failing to reach agreement with the England and Wales Cricket Board on a new contract. The ECB later faced a deluge of criticism about losing his services to their greatest rivals.
England will be coached by Andy Flower in Australia, with Graham Gooch assisting the batsmen, David Saker the fast bowlers and Mushtaq Ahmed working with the spinners.

88;"Fernando Alonso reigns supreme for Ferrari in Singapore
Highlights - Singapore Grand Prix
By Richard Rae
Ferrari's Fernando Alonso held off Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel from start to finish to win a superbly hard-fought and eventful Singapore Grand Prix.
McLaren's Lewis Hamilton failed to finish after colliding with the Red Bull of Mark Webber.
Webber went on to finish third, ahead of Hamilton's team-mate Jenson Button.
Alonso's win lifts the Spaniard to second in the drivers' championship, just 11 points behind Webber, with Hamilton nine points adrift in third.
It was a fascinating and attritional grand prix, which may have marked a decisive turning point in the world championship.
Although only 25 points cover the top five in the drivers' standings with four races remaining, the fact Alonso was able to follow his win in Italy with a second successive victory when Vettel again appeared to have the slightly faster car was significant.
It was also hugely disappointing for McLaren. Even before Hamilton's accident the British team were struggling to match their rivals for pace, and it is hard to see them closing the growing gap in time for Hamilton and Button to renew their championship challenges.
Alonso delighted after 'difficult race'
Alonso acknowledged how hard the race had been.
""Not an easy race in terms of physically, conditions and also mechanically, but we tried to keep control everything, avoiding the walls,"" he said.
""After the first stop the race was pretty much under control. I was not too much worried about the gap with Sebastian, I was more worried about the people we were lapping.""
Vettel, who is now fourth in the standings, a point behind Hamilton, was philosophical.
""I tried to push him as hard as I could, but he didn't make a major mistake,"" he said.
""But the most important thing is the car was competitive. Something was a bit missing yesterday [during qualifying].
""[The result] helps us in the constructors [championship], and in the drivers' everything is still open.""
Andrew Benson's blog
Fernando Alonso's victory in the first of the five deciding races of the season has fundamentally altered the dynamics of the title battle.
Webber was satisfied with third after a gamble on strategy during an early safety car period paid off.
""I didn't feel mega comfortable here this weekend, so I'm very happy with how the race went,"" he said.
""It was easy to panic and worry about losing a lot of time behind guys. Getting out of bed this morning I would have taken third.""
The fact the first five on the grid came out of the second corner in unchanged order - albeit that Alonso, from pole, mercilessly chopped across Vettel as the German closed up - did not appear to bode well for those hoping to see plenty of passing action.
Title is a tough call now - Hamilton
Their consolation was that no Singapore Grand Prix has been completed without a safety car period shaking things up, and sure enough, suspension damage forced Vitantonio Liuzzi to stop his Force India on track on lap three.
Offered a chance to gamble, Red Bull called in Webber for an immediate change from soft tyres to the harder 'prime' compound - the only one of the front-runners to pit.
The Australian rejoined in 11th, and quickly muscled his way past Virgin's Timo Glock and then, on the inside at Turn Five, Kamui Kobayashi's Sauber.
Up front, Alonso was keeping Vettel at bay, with the McLaren drivers dropping away behind them.
Webber was now some 18 seconds behind Alonso, and it was beginning to look as though the top four would be able to build up a big enough gap to pit for a change of tyres and still emerge comfortably in front.
By lap 21, Webber was almost 40 seconds behind Alonso, but the McLarens were struggling, and with the pit stops approaching, the championship leader was only 20 seconds behind Hamilton in third.
Hamilton came in on lap 29, Button on lap 30, and both were duly jumped by Webber. Red Bull called in Vettel, but Ferrari immediately responded to bring Alonso in on the same lap, ensuring he stayed ahead at the matched stop.
I needed to be on podium - Button
Now it looked like a straight race to the flag, but a second safety car period - caused when Kobayashi dumped his Sauber into the railings at Turn 18 and collected Bruno Senna - brought the field back together.
The restart resulted in disaster for Hamilton. Webber was held up by a Virgin, and as he got past Hamilton closed up and began to overtake going into turn seven.
But the Englishman had not fully completed the pass when the two cars came into the corner. Webber had the inside line as Hamilton turned in, and the two cars came together.
While Webber was able to continue, the resulting damage to the McLaren - and possibly to Hamilton's world title hopes - was terminal. The stewards announced the incident would be investigated, but concluded no further action was required.
Hamilton was understandably downcast.
""I'm not really sure what happened, he was in my blind spot, I didn't see him alongside me, next thing I know is my tyre's blown and that's it,"" he said.
""[With not finishing at the previous Grand Prix in Italy] I couldn't have had a worse two races at this time of year. Hopefully myself or Jenson can still win the world championship.""
Ahead of Webber, Vettel and Alonso were exchanging fastest laps. The gap remained constant at about a second, but the final lap saw Vettel harrying Alonso as they came up to lap backmarkers. The Spaniard made no mistake.

Ecclestone admits to Korean GP concerns
Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone has expressed doubts over whether October's Korean Grand Prix will go ahead.
Ecclestone hopes the race will happen but says concerns will remain until the Yeongam track passes an FIA inspection.
""It's not good. It should have been inspected six weeks ago,"" he told BBC Sport at Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix.
A Korean race official admitted they were taking Ecclestone's remarks ""seriously"" but they would be ready to host the race as scheduled.
""We will have no problem in hosting the race on October 24 as we have almost completed work,"" revealed Korea Auto Valley Operation (KAVO) spokesman Kim Jae-Ho.
The Korean International Circuit, which has still to be completed, was initially scheduled for an inspection on 21 September, but that was a public holiday in Korea.
I actually think he's just giving a few people there a serious hurry-up and a warning.
Martin Brundle
FIA press officer Alexandra Schieren said the new inspection, by FIA race director Charlie Whiting, would take place on 11 October.
""We will rush to complete work and FIA officials will see a complete circuit when they conduct a final inspection in two weeks,"" said Kim.
""We take Ecclestone's remarks seriously as a message that we have to step up preparations for the race.""
Ecclestone had expressed doubts that the race would go ahead.

""We normally have a 90-day check before a race and now we are sort of putting this off,"" he stated.
""What we've done is quite dangerous. It's a question of do we cancel the race or not? They say everything will be OK - we have to hope they're right.""
BBC F1 analyst Martin Brundle believes Ecclestone's comments are intended as a warning to KAVO.
""It's very unusual for Bernie to send a message like that unless he wants to get a message out [to Korea]. It was very powerful,"" explained Brundle.
""I actually think he's just giving a few people there a serious hurry-up and a warning.
""I think we will be going to the race, because it would have a massive impact on the championship if there are only three rounds remaining instead of four.
606: DEBATE
New circuits should not be added to the F1 calendar until they have been completed and proven with a season of racing
Richard
""Whether the alternative would be to try to put another race on or we could have a double-header at one of the existing venues remains to be seen.""
In addition, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told BBC Sport: ""I think they'll get it done. They're pretty committed and I think the race will happen.
F1 cars are scheduled to take to the track for practice on Friday 22 October, qualifying a day later and the race on Sunday 24 October.
The Korean circuit is the only new venue on the F1 calendar this season and has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the man behind the layouts of the new tracks in Malaysia, China, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi.
The next race is in Japan on 10 October, followed by Korea, Brazil (on 7 November) and finally Abu Dhabi (on 14 November).
Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso's victory in Singapore at the weekend means he now trails Red Bull's Mark Webber by 11 points in the drivers' championship, with Lewis Hamilton of McLaren nine points further adrift in third.

Politics: The Labor Party, under Kevin Rudd, won a landslide victory in elections in November 2007, ending more than 11 years in power for the Liberal Party under John Howard.
Economy: The strong, services-based economy has seen sustained growth; mining and agriculture provide the lion's share of exports
International: Australia is a regional policeman; further afield, its troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan
Timeline
Migration continues to shape Australia and is a politically-sensitive issue. The country has taken a tough stance on unauthorised arrivals, but has scrapped a controversial policy of holding asylum seekers in detention centres until their cases are heard.
Originally composed of six separate colonies of the British Empire, Australia's path to independent statehood began with the formation of a common federal state in 1901, and was largely complete by World War II. The last few remaining constitutional links with the United Kingdom were severed in 1986.
However, Australia remains part of the British Commonwealth, and the UK monarch remains the formal head of state, represented by the governor-general, who has a largely ceremonial role.
There is an influential republican movement and the debate over future of the monarchy is a recurring issue in Australian politics. In a 1999 referendum, nearly 55% of Australians voted against becoming a republic.
The country has federal structure, with the six states retaining extensive powers, particularly over education, police, the judiciary and transport.
Australia's growing orientation towards its Asian neighbours is reflected in its economic policy. It is a key member of Apec, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and aims to forge free trade deals with China and Asean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
It has also played a bigger regional role, mediating between warring groups in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, as well as deploying thousands of peacekeepers in newly-independent East Timor.
The island continent combines a wide variety of landscapes. These include deserts in the interior, hills and mountains, tropical rainforests, and densely-populated coastal strips with long beaches and coral reefs off the shoreline.
Isolated from other continents, Australia has an abundance of unique plant and animal life.

While oil and gas exports account for the bulk of government revenues, reserves are dwindling and Brunei is attempting to diversify its economy. It markets itself as a financial centre and as a destination for upmarket and eco-tourism.
About two-thirds of the people of Brunei are ethnic Malays, and these benefit from positive discrimination. The Chinese comprise about 16% of the population. There are also Indians and indigenous groups, of whom the Murut and Dusuns are favoured over the Ibans.
Since 1962 the sultan has ruled by decree. In a rare move towards political reform an appointed parliament was revived in 2004. The constitution provides for an expanded house with up to 15 elected MPs. However, no date has been set for elections.
Brunei's financial fortunes have wavered. Shares and other assets were hit by the crash of the Asian financial markets in the late 1990s. In 1998 Prince Jefri's Amedeo conglomerate collapsed, leaving massive debts and precipitating a financial scandal.

Head of state: Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
Senior General Than Shwe is the country's top military leader and heads the SPDC, the body of 12 senior generals that runs the country and makes the key decisions.
Than Shwe, a one-time specialist in psychological warfare
He has steadfastly ruled out a transfer of power to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).
In 1993 he established the National Convention, a reconciliation process aimed at drawing up a new constitution.
After more than 15 years of deliberations boycotted by the NLD, the government declared the process over. The new constitution was enacted in 2008.
Critics argued that, rather than ushering in genuine political change, the new basic law cemented the military's political dominance.
The new constitution reserves a quarter of seats in both houses of parliament for officers, and effectively bars Aung San Suu Kyi from holding office.
Under an election law passed in early 2010, the electoral commission was chosen solely by Burma's military rulers. The main military-backed party claimed a resounding victory in elections held in November 2010, which the junta presented as marking the transition from military rule to a civilian democracy.
Born in 1933 near the town of Mandalay, Than Shwe joined the army at the age of 20. His career included a stint in the department of psychological warfare. He was decorated more than 16 times during his career as a soldier.
He is said to be introverted and superstitious, frequently seeking the advice of astrologers.
Reports in early 2007 said the 73-year-old had sought treatment in Singapore for an undisclosed medical condition.
Power struggles have plagued Burma's military leadership. Prime Minister Khin Nyunt was sacked and arrested in 2004. The former premier, who said he supported Aung San Suu Kyi's involvement in the National Convention, was seen as a moderate who was at odds with the junta's hardliners.

Only now is the country beginning to put the mechanism in place to bring those responsible for the ""killing fields"" to justice. Cambodia and the UN have agreed to set up a tribunal to try the surviving leaders of the genocide years.
The tribunal held its first public hearing - a bail request by one of the defendants - in November 2007.

The first trial - of former prison warder Kaing Guek Eav, or Comrade Duch - started in 2009 and reached a guilty verdict in July 2010. The trial of four more Khmer Rouge leaders is expected to begin in 2011.
In pursuit of a rural utopia, the Khmer Rouge abolished money and private property and ordered city dwellers into the countryside to cultivate the fields.
The effects can still be seen today, with around 70% of Cambodia's workforce employed in subsistence farming.
The Mekong River provides fertile, irrigated fields for rice production.
Exports of clothing generate most of Cambodia's foreign exchange and tourism is also important.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war. The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
Beijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland. The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere.
The leadership of Mao Tse-Tung oversaw the often brutal implementation of a Communist vision of society. Millions died in the Great Leap Forward - a programme of state control over agriculture and rapid industrialisation - and the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic attempt to root out elements seen as hostile to Communist rule.
However, Mao's death in 1976 ushered in a new leadership and economic reform. In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise.
The rate of economic change hasn't been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's biggest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people. The authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps.
Economy
China's economic transformation has not been joined by political change
Nowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad.
The collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth.
As a member of the World Trade Organization, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods. The former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports.
Some Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability.
Moreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project.
Social discontent
The economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom.
Potent symbol: Mao's portrait surveys Beijing's Tiananmen Square
Social discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions.
Other pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection. A downside of the economic boom has been environmental degradation; China is home to many of the world's most-polluted cities.
Human rights
Human rights campaigners continue to criticise China for executing hundreds of people every year and for failing to stop torture. The country is keen to stamp down on what it sees as dissent among its ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs in the north-west. The authorities have targeted the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which they designate an ""evil cult"".
Chinese rule over Tibet is controversial. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the persecution of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader who is campaigning for autonomy within China.

Black pearls are the chief export. Agriculture, the sale of fishing licences to foreign fleets and offshore finance are also key revenue earners.
The Cook Islands are prone to tropical storms; Hurricane Martin devastated the northern islands in 1997 causing substantial losses for the black pearl industry.

96;"Portugal began to establish colonial control over Timor in the 16th century, when the island was divided into small states. The Netherlands later colonised the west of the island, which was formally partitioned between the two imperial powers in 1916.
Portugal invested little in Timor, and withdrew unilaterally in 1975 after deciding to dissolve its colonial empire.
Indonesia invaded within days of the Timorese declaration of independence, and used force to crush popular resistance.
Independence followed years of oppressive rule
Major world and regional powers did little to counter Indonesian rule, which was not recognised by the UN. Falintil guerrillas fought for independence, and their cause captured world attention in 1991 when Indonesian forces opened fire on a memorial procession in the capital, Dili, killing at least 250 people.
International pressure increased and finally persuaded Indonesia to let allow an independence referendum in 1999, during which a pro-Indonesian militia, apparently with Indonesian army support, tried in vain to use terror to discourage voters.
When the referendum showed overwhelming support for independence, the militia went on the rampage, murdering hundreds and reducing towns to ruins. An international peacekeeping force halted the mayhem and paved the way for a United Nations mission which helped reconstruct East Timor.
The rebuilding of East Timor has been one of the UN's biggest success stories. The UN Mission of Support in East Timor, Unmiset, wound up in May 2005.
But security has been precarious. An outbreak of gang violence in 2006 prompted the UN Security Council to set up a new peacekeeping force, Unmit. The UN said poverty and unemployment had exacerbated the unrest.
Unrest in 2006 led to the deployment of peacekeepers
As one of Asia's poorest nations, East Timor will rely on outside help for many years. The infrastructure is poor and the country is drought-prone.
However, vast offshore oil and gas fields in the Timor Sea hold much potential. East Timor and Australia have agreed to share revenues from the reserves. As a part of the deal, a decision on the disputed maritime border in the area was deferred.
East Timor is trying to foster national reconciliation. Indonesia and East Timor set up bodies to bring the perpetrators of the 1999 violence to justice. However a 2005 UN report concluded that the systems had failed to deliver. The Indonesian special court acquitted most of the 18 indicted suspects.

A veteran army officer, diplomat and hereditary chief, Epeli Nailatikau became president in July 2009 on the retirement of his predecessor Josefa Iloilo.
He was ousted as army chief by coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka in 1987, and joined the diplomatic corps. He turned down an opportunity to become prime minister after the 2000 coup, but served in the interim government of Laisenia Qarase.
He was elected speaker after democracy was restored in 2001, and held ministerial posts after the 2006 coup. President Iloilo appointed him vice-president in April 2009, at the same time as he suspended the constitution. Mr Nailatikau endorsed President Iloilo's decision on taking office himself a few months later.
Interim prime minister: Commodore Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama
Bainimarama tightened his grip on power in April 2009
Fiji's military chief Commodore Frank Bainimarama seized power in the December 2006 coup and first became interim prime minister in January 2007.
He accused deposed prime minister Laisenia Qarase of corruption and of discriminating against Fiji's ethnic Indian minority.
Mr Qarase, who had secured a second term in May 2006, had angered the opposition and the military with his controversial proposal to pardon or amnesty some of those behind the 2000 nationalist coup.
Commodore Bainimarama promised to restore democracy through elections, but said the constitution would have to be revised first, as in his view it enshrined racial divisions.
He maintains that his aim is to create a fairer, multi-racial society, but he has excluded political opponents from discussions on the constitutional reforms.
A move by Fiji's Appeal Court in April 2009 to declare the military government illegal prompted the president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, to suspend the constitution and reappoint Commodore Bainimarama as interim prime minister for a further five years, leaving the military chief's grip on power apparently stronger than ever.
Commodore Bainimarama insists that he enjoys broad popular support for his elections reform plan, but the events of April 2009 have made Fiji even more of a diplomatic outcast than before.

European contact was gradual; the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and British were credited with the discovery of one or more of the islands. In the 18th century European traders and missionaries came, bringing diseases which wiped out much of the indigenous population.
Tahiti offers spectacular tropical mountain landscapes
The missionaries tried to put a stop to local religious practices, nudity and other aspects of indigenous life. Some forms of Polynesian culture were lost for many years.
Tahiti, in the Society islands, became a French colony in 1880. France later annexed other islands to form the French Colony of Oceania. In 1946 the islands became an overseas territory and in 2004 gained ""overseas country"" status.
Pro-independence movements flourished in the 1970s and over time the islands took more control of internal affairs, culminating in a statute granting increased autonomy in 1996.
There has been friction with Paris over nuclear testing. France conducted 41 atmospheric tests on the Mururoa atoll and neighbouring Fangataufa from 1966. In 1975, under international pressure, it switched to underground tests.
Ending a three year moratorium, French President Jacques Chirac said testing would resume in 1995. The move provoked international anger and protests in Papeete turned violent.
Nuclear tests took place on Mururoa and Fangataufa
Tests were carried out between 1966-1996
UN study said radioactivity levels were negligible
Test site dismantled in 1998
Six of the eight planned tests were carried out, the last one in January 1996. At the end of the programme Paris agreed to a 10-year compensation package.
In 1995 the UN's nuclear watchdog concluded that radiation levels around the atolls posed no threat. In 1999 Paris admitted that fractures had been discovered in the coral cone at the sites. The atolls continue to be monitored.
In March 2009, the French government enacted legislation to allow compensation for former workers at France's nuclear weapons test sites.
French Polynesia enjoys a high standard of living, but wealth is unevenly distributed and unemployment is high.
Tourism is an important money-earner; travellers favour Tahiti and Bora Bora. Boasting a year-round warm climate, volcanic peaks and tranquil lagoons, it is easy to see why the islands are popular. French Polynesia is, though, prone to typhoons.

Guam's diverse population includes Japanese, Chinese, and incomers from other Pacific islands. The indigenous Chamorro are a people of mixed Micronesian, Spanish and Filipino descent.
The island was settled in the second century BC. A Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan arrived in 1521; under Spanish rule the native population was decimated by disease and the suppression of rebellions.
Guam was ceded to the US in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. The island was occupied by Japan during World War II. Many Guamanians died under the occupation before the territory was wrested from Japanese control in 1944.
After more than a century of change and development, Spain's mark is still apparent in the Chamorro language, the cuisine, and in annual fiestas.
Guam is vulnerable to storms. Typhoons swept across the island in 2002, leaving around 35,000 people homeless.

Hong Kong is governed under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", under which China has agreed to give the region a high degree of autonomy and to preserve its economic and social systems for 50 years from the date of the handover.
Hong Kong's Victoria Peak offers spectacular vistas
Hong Kong's constitution, the Basic Law, provides for the development of democratic processes. However, Beijing can veto changes to the political system and pro-democracy forces have been frustrated by what they see as the slow pace of political reform.
China controls Hong Kong's foreign and defence policies, but the territory has its own currency and customs status.
Hong Kong's economy has moved away from manufacturing and is now services-based. The region is a major corporate and banking centre as well as a conduit for China's burgeoning exports. Its deepwater port is one of the world's busiest.
Companies based in Hong Kong employ millions of workers in the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong.
China ceded Hong Kong island to Britain in 1842 after the First Opium War. Britain later added parts of the Kowloon peninsula and the many smaller islands surrounding Hong Kong to its holdings.
In the 19th and 20th centuries Hong Kong's population was boosted by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants from China, many of whom were fleeing domestic upheavals. Industrialisation gathered pace, and by the 1970s Hong Kong had become an ""Asian tiger""; one of the region's economic powerhouses.
With little room for expansion across its hilly terrain, high-rise Hong Kong has among the highest population density in the world; some 6,300 people per square kilometre. Skyscrapers and temples, shopping malls and traditional markets sit cheek-by-jowl.
But amid the urban hustle there are quiet parks and green spaces, beaches and mountain-top views.

President: Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
Former army general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won Indonesia's first-ever direct presidential elections in September 2004, in what was hailed as the first peaceful transition of power in Indonesia's history.
Mr Yudhoyono has made the fight against terrorism a key priority
He was re-elected in July 2009 in a landslide victory on the back of improved security and strong growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.
Mr Yudhoyono has cultivated an image as a tough and dedicated corruption fighter with high moral integrity; pledges to crack down even harder on corruption were one of the main planks of his 2009 election campaign.
However, his failure to take a firmer line against two officials at the centre of a high-level corruption scandal that broke towards the end of 2009 raised questions about his commitment to root out graft in Indonesia.
He is credited with having ushered in an era of financial and political stability, restoring economic growth as the country slowly recovered from the devastating Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.
The global financial crisis of 2008-9 did not hit Indonesia as badly as some of its neighbours, though millions of Indonesian citizens still live under the poverty line.
A former security minister in the Megawati government, Mr Yudhoyono has identified the fight against terrorism as a key challenge. As security minister he spearheaded operations to capture the Islamic extremists blamed for the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings.
The first year of Mr Yudhoyono's first term brought perhaps his biggest challenge, the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster. His administration also won international plaudits for signing a peace deal in 2005 with separatist rebels in Aceh province.
His Democratic Party emerged from the April 2009 parliamentary elections as the largest party.
Mr Yudhoyono, a fluent English speaker, studied for his master's degree in the US. Rising through the ranks under former President Suharto, he led his country's peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia in the 1990s.
Mr Yudhoyono also completed several tours of duty in the Indonesian-occupied East Timor.
Married with two sons, the president has released several albums featuring his own love songs, some of them now covered by Indonesian boy bands.

Head of state: Emperor Akihito
Akihito succeeded his father, Hirohito, in 1989. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan's emperors have a purely ceremonial role.
Prime minister: Naoto Kan
Naoto Kan became prime minister in June 2010, following the resignation of Yukio Hatoyama amid a damaging dispute over a US air base.
Naoto Kan exposed government culpability in a tainted blood scandal
A former leftist activist, Mr Kan is Japan's fifth premier in four years, and the first in over a decade not to hail from a political dynasty.
Mr Hatoyama's government, in which Mr Kan served as deputy PM, came to power in a groundbreaking election in 2009 which saw the centre-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) end decades of rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party.
But Mr Hatoyama's support plummeted after he backtracked on an election promise to move the unpopular US base off Okinawa, enraging locals as well as the pacifist Social Democrats, who quit his coalition.
Mr Kan said he would honour an agreement to relocate the US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa.
But soon after he became PM, his government lost its majority in the upper house of parliament in July elections. The defeat meant it would need opposition support in the upper house to pass some legislation.
The loss was blamed on comments by Mr Kan suggesting that Japan's 5% sales tax be doubled. In September, however, he survived a leadership challenge from the DPJ's veteran power-broker, Ichiro Ozawa.
The same month, Mr Kan's poll ratings were hit by the decision to free a Chinese trawler captain arrested in disputed waters, in what was widely seen as a diplomatic defeat.
Mr Kan, the son of a factory manager and a graduate of applied sciences, campaigned in the 1970s for pacifist and environmental causes and entered parliament with a leftist party in 1980. He help to found the then-opposition Democratic Party in 1996.
He achieved popularity in the mid-1990s when as health minister he brought to light government culpability in a scandal over HIV-tainted blood products. In January 2010, Mr Kan, took over as finance minister.

Astana: Oil money is driving the new capital's development
The main religion, Islam, was suppressed like all others under Communist rule, but has enjoyed a revival since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
There has been major foreign investment in the Caspian oil sector. Oil development has brought rapid economic growth, although expansion slowed in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis.
An oil pipeline linking the Tengiz oil field in western Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk opened in 2001. In 2008, Kazakhstan began pumping some oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, as part of a drive to lessen its dependence on Russia as a transit country. A pipeline to China was opened in late 2005, with work on another starting in 2008.
Nevertheless, poverty is still widespread and Kazakhstan continues to face major economic challenges, particularly with unemployment and inflation. At the same time, a small minority of Kazakhs grew very rich after independence through privatization and other business deals which opposition politician alleged to have been corrupt.
The people of Kazakhstan also have to live with the aftermath of Soviet-era nuclear testing and toxic waste dumping, as well as with increasing drug addiction and a growing incidence of HIV/Aids. Inefficient Soviet irrigation projects led to severe shrinkage of the heavily polluted Aral Sea.

International: The armstice of 1953 ended armed conflict on the Korean peninsular, but the two Koreas are technically still at war; tensions have been exacerbated in recent decades by North Korea's nuclear ambitions
Timeline
Decades of this rigid state-controlled system have led to stagnation and a leadership dependent on the cult of personality.
Aid agencies have estimated that up to two million people have died since the mid-1990s because of acute food shortages caused by natural disasters and economic mismanagement. The country relies on foreign aid to feed millions of its people.
The totalitarian state also stands accused of systematic human rights abuses. Reports of torture, public executions, slave labour, and forced abortions and infanticides in prison camps have emerged. A US-based rights group has estimated that there are up to 200,000 political prisoners in North Korea.
Pyongyang has accused successive South Korean governments of being US ""puppets"", but South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's visit in 2000 signalled a thaw in relations. Seoul's ""sunshine policy"" towards the north aimed to encourage change through dialogue and aid.
Nuclear tensions
This tentative reaching-out to the world was dealt a blow in 2002 by Pyongyang's decision to reactivate a nuclear reactor and to expel international inspectors.
In October 2006 North Korea said it had successfully tested a nuclear weapon, spreading alarm throughout the region.
Since then, intensive diplomatic efforts have aimed to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. After years of on-and-off talks, a deal was thrashed out in February 2007 under which Pyongyang agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor in return for aid and diplomatic concessions.
But negotiations stalled as North Korea accused its negotiating partners - the US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations.
Tensions between North Korea and the rest of the world increased steadily again from late 2008 onwards, especially after the new South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, ended his predecessor's ""sunshine policy"" of rapprochement with the North.
In April 2009 North Korea walked out of international talks aimed at ending its nuclear activities. The following month the country carried out its second ever underground nuclear test and announced that it no longer considered itself bound by the terms of the 1953 truce that ended the war between the two Koreas.
Tensions reached a new high in spring 2010, when the South accused North Korea of being responsible for sinking of one of its warships, the Cheonan, and cut off all cross-border trade. Pyongyang denied the claims, and in turn severed all ties with Seoul.
After the US imposed tough sanctions in August, the North began to make overtures again. Kim Jong-il signalled a readiness to resume six-party nuclear talks during a visit to China, and indicated a willingness to accept Southern aid to cope with major flood damage.
North Korea maintains one of the world's largest standing armies and militarism pervades everyday life. But standards of training, discipline and equipment in the force are said to be low.

They helped transform South Korea into one of the world's major economies and a leading exporter of cars and electronic goods.
Although the South Korean economy is now the third largest in Asia and the 13th in the world, the high levels of foreign debt held by the country's banks have left them exposed to the fallout from the global credit crisis.
A multi-party political system was restored in 1987, and President Roh Tae-Woo launched an anti-corruption campaign against both his own party and his political predecessor.
The South-North border is the world's most heavily-fortified frontier
Relations with its northern neighbour remain a major concern in Seoul, particularly over the North's fragile economy and its nuclear ambitions. South Korea generally resisted international calls for sanctions against the North over its nuclear programme and pursued a ""sunshine"" policy of engagement in the late 1990s.
This has involved aid - including shipments of fertiliser and rice - reunions between North and South Koreans, tourist projects and economic cooperation. South Korean companies employed thousands of North Korean workers at the Kaesong industrial complex near the border.
The ""sunshine"" ended with the election in 2008 of conservative President Lee Myung-bak, who adopted a tougher tone towards the North in response to its failure to move on the nuclear issue.
Tensions were heightened further by a spate of Northern missile tests in 2009 and then by the sinking of the Southern naval ship Cheonan in March 2010, in which 46 sailors died.
After international investigators reported finding evidence that the Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine, South Korea stopped all trade between the two states. Pyongyang rejected the claim as ""fabrication"" and retaliated by cutting all relations with Seoul.
The demilitarised zone (DMZ) between South and North Korea is the world's most heavily-fortified frontier. But the US, which maintains tens of thousands of soldiers in South Korea, is pulling its forces away from the front line and plans to reduce troop numbers.

Economics: Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries of the former Soviet Union
International: Kyrgyzstan hosts Russian and US military airbases
Timeline
Kyrgyzstan's democratic credentials were regarded as relatively strong in the immediate post-Soviet era, but this reputation was lost when corruption and nepotism took hold during President Akayev's years in office. Parliamentary and presidential elections were flawed, opposition figures faced harassment and imprisonment, and opposition newspapers were closed.
His successor after the 2005 revolt, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, failed to restore full confidence in state institutions at home or abroad. His time in office was marred by political instability and an almost constant struggle with parliament over the constitutional balance of power.
Elections held under Mr Bakiyev were criticised as being undemocratic, and human rights groups expressed concern over the curtailing of civil liberties and attacks on the media.
Civil tensions again came to a head in April 2010, when Mr Bakiyev himself was toppled and an interim government was set up under the leadership of former Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva.
The Kyrgyz make up nearly 70% of the population, with Uzbeks accounting for about 15% and concentrated in the Ferghana Valley in the south. Russians have a significant presence in the north and in the capital, Bishkek.
There is tension between the Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities in the south over land and housing, and relations with Uzbekistan were strained following the flight of refugees into Kyrgyzstan after clashes in the Uzbek city Andijan in 2005.
There have been several serious outbreaks of Kyrgyz-Uzbek interethnic violence in the southern city of Osh, notably in 1990 - when hundreds were killed - and again in June 2010 following the overthrow of Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Osh had been a Bakiyev stronghold.
Most of the population of Kyrgyzstan is nominally Muslim, and there has been a growing interest in Islam among those seeking a new ethnic or national identity.
The government is worried about inroads by jihadist groups like Hizb-ut Tahrir, and there have been periodic outbreaks of fighting in the south.
Kyrgyzstan also features in the US-Russian rivalry for control of Central Asia, as both powers have military air bases in the country.
The US established an air base at the Manas international airport near Bishkek in late 2001 to support military operations in Afghanistan. President Bakiyev threatened to close it in October 2008 after agreeing to a Russian loan. He reversed the decision when the US agreed to more than triple its annual rent for the base.
Weeks later Kyrgyzstan tentatively agreed to allow Russia to open a second military base on its territory, apparently expanding Moscow's military reach to balance the US presence.

Outside the capital, many people live without electricity or access to basic facilities. But Laos is banking on the anticipated returns from a billion-dollar dam scheme, intended to generate electricity for export to Thailand, to boost its economy and infrastructure.

Its economy revolves around tourism. Macau has capitalised on its long history as a gambling centre, drawing many thousands of visitors from China and Hong Kong.
Foreign casino companies have invested heavily since Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho's decades-long monopoly on the gaming industry ended in 2002. New ""mega-casinos"", which include major hotel developments, have replaced traditional gambling dens.
Colonial architecture remains, but Portugal's stamp on Macau is fading
In 2006 the returns from the casino boom surpassed the revenues of the US gambling mecca, Las Vegas. But analysts warn that Macau risks relying too much on the industry.
Some politicians and academics say most locals have yet to benefit from the economic boom.
The former colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 after 400 years of Portuguese rule. Beijing promised to uphold Western-style freedoms for at least 50 years.
Although it is part of China, Macau is governed under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, under which it has a large degree of autonomy.
Pro-reform forces are less vocal in Macau than in Hong Kong. A new state security law came into effect in 2009 with very little opposition, whereas attempts by the Chinese government to introduce a similar law in Hong Kong in 2003 triggered mass protests.
The campaign for universal suffrage in Hong Kong is being watched with keen interest in Macau. China is unlikely to grant greater democratic rights unless consistent pressure is applied by pro-democract campaigners - something that seems far less likely to happen in Macau than in Hong Kong.
Portuguese seafarers settled in the area in the 1500s. Initially, the colony prospered on the lucrative returns from regional trade, and European-style mansions and churches mushroomed.
Trade dwindled from the 1600s, but the introduction of licensed gambling in the mid 1800s revived Macau's fortunes.

Malaysia's new king takes office
The sultan is a former ruler of oil-rich Terengganu state. He was 44 when he was sworn in.
The king's role is largely ceremonial, although he is nominal head of the armed forces and all laws and the appointment of every cabinet minister require his assent.
Under Malaysia's constitutional monarchy, the position of king is rotated every five years between each of the nine hereditary state rulers.
Malaysia's first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, himself a prince, devised the system after independence in 1957 to spread power among the sultans and rajas who had ruled over fiefdoms on the Malay peninsula for hundreds of years.

Najib Razak was guaranteed the post of prime minister in March 2009 when he became the leader of the United Malays National Organisation, the main party in the National Front ruling coalition.
Like his predecessor, Mr Najib came to the job promising reforms
The son of the country's second prime minister and nephew of the third, Mr Najib is regarded by many Malaysians as political blue blood and seems to have been destined for the premiership from an early age.
A British-trained economist, he first entered parliament at the age of 23 - becoming the youngest MP in Malaysian history - and quickly rose to prominence.
He held numerous cabinet posts - including finance and defence - before becoming prime minister.
He took over the premiership at a turbulent time, and faces the enormous challenge of steering the country through the global financial crisis, which has hit the economy hard.
Mr Najib pledged radical reforms and a more transparent government. He said that one of his priorities would be to close a widening ethnic and religious divide, after Malaysia's ethnic minorities shifted towards the opposition in large numbers in the 2008 polls, fearing their rights were being eroded.
But his rise to power was marked by a government crackdown on the resurgent opposition, with allegations that strong-arm tactics were being used to stifle political dissent.
His predecessor, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, resigned as prime minister in April 2009 after the governing coalition suffered a heavy defeat in a general election in March 2008.

Under the compact, the US pays an annual rent to use the Kwajalein atoll as a base and missile test range.
The legacy of the post-war US occupation is seen particularly starkly on Bikini and Enewetak, which were both used for nuclear weapons testing between 1946 and 1958.
The US paid $150 million in a compensation package for the test victims in the 1980s. But whilst Enewetak has been partly decontaminated, Bikini is still uninhabitable. The Marshall Islands has petitioned for additional compensation.
A major problem for the islands is how to gain some measure of financial independence from the US. Imports dwarf exports, unemployment is high and many islanders live by subsistence farming.
Tourism is one option; unspoiled beaches abound and the islands are an ideal base for scuba diving and sports fishing. The islands also sell fishing rights to other countries, and offer ship registrations under the Marshall Islands flag.

Though formally independent, in 1986 Micronesia signed a ""Compact of Free Association"" with the US. Under this, Washington took on responsibility for defence and gained the right to set up military bases and deny other nations access to Micronesia. In return, Micronesia received financial assistance averaging $100m per year, and the right of Micronesians to live and work in the US. Micronesia also takes its cue from Washington on foreign policy.
A renegotiated 20-year compact, worth $3.5 billion to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, was signed by US President George W Bush in December 2003. Some of the money is being diverted into trust funds, intended to provide a financial resource for Micronesia after the compact expires.
Despite its small population and the large amount of incoming aid from the US, Japan and elsewhere, Micronesia has relatively high unemployment, a matter compounded by increasing numbers of Filipino migrant workers.
Many Micronesians live without electricity or running water, which is in short supply and is sometimes rationed. The gap between rich and poor is increasing as business and officials benefit disproportionately from US aid donations.
Micronesia's biggest challenge is to find a way of lessening its dependence on foreign aid. Given the islands' splendid beaches and scuba diving opportunities, tourism offers one possibility, but this is constrained by the lack of adequate infrastructure and the islands' remoteness.

President: Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj
Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj won the presidency with a narrow election win over incumbent Nambaryn Enkhbayar in May 2009 and took office in June.
Mr Elbegdorj was elected on a pledge to fight graft and poverty.
Standing for the opposition Democratic Party, Mr Elbegdorj won just over 51% of the vote, to 47% for Mr Enkhbayar, whose ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) said it accepted the result as fair.
The peaceful outcome came after fears of a repeat of the violence which followed opposition claims of fraud after the Democratic Party's defeat in the 2008 parliamentary elections.
Mr Elbegdorj campaigned on promises to fight corruption and to spread the profits of Mongolia's mineral wealth more widely.
To achieve the second aim, he planned to tighten rules for contracts under which foreign mining firms operate.
His message proved popular in the big cities, especially the capital Ulan Bator, and was helped by widespread poverty.
However, he faced a parliament which continued to be dominated by a solid MPRP majority, but the then MPRP prime minister, Sanjagiin Bayar, promised to ensure that his government would work well with the president.
Although the prime minister and parliament exercise real political power, the president heads the armed forces and has the power of veto in parliament. Frequent changes of government have enhanced the role of the presidency.
Born in 1963, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj was one of the leaders of the peaceful revolution that ended the Communist dictatorship in 1990.
Since then, he has served as prime minister twice, briefly in 1998, and in 2006-8.
Prime Minister: Sukhbaataryn Batbold
Foreign Minister Sukhbaataryn Batbold became prime minister unexpectedly in October 2009 when his predecessor Sanjagiin Bayar resigned for health reasons.
Mr Batbold consolidated his hold on power when he also took over from Mr Bayar as leader of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in April 2010.
Born in 1963, Mr Batbold ran the Mongolian side of a major gold-mining venture with the Canadian company Centerra Gold in 1992-2000, and his wife now runs his hotel and cashmere industry interests in the Altai Trading Company.
Mr Batbold has continued his predecessor's policy of encouraging foreign investment in the mining industries and seeking to work with President Elbegdorj of the rival Democratic Party.

Marcus Stephen was sworn in as president in December 2007, after his predecessor, Ludwig Scotty, lost a no-confidence vote in the Pacific island's 18-member single-chamber parliament.
Political disputes have dogged Marcus Stephen's time in office
However, parliament remained deadlocked over the budget, with the 18 MPs evenly divided. To resolve the impasse, Mr Stephen declared a state of emergency and dissolved parliament. His government went on to win a majority in snap elections in April 2008.
He was re-elected for a second term by parliament in November 2010, after another protracted phase of political deadlock.
The crisis had started when opposition lawmakers mounted repeated no-confidence motions from February 2010 onwards. Two inconclusive general elections, in April and June, failed to resolve to impasse, both leaving parliament finally balanced, with 9 MPs on each sides.
The government continued to govern under a state of emergency until both sides agreed to form a coalition. Under the deal, former President Ludwig Scotty became speaker of parliament.

Mr Stephen is a former professional weightlifter and multiple Commonwealth Games medallist.
He was elected to parliament in 2003 and served as education and finance minister, but stood down after Mr Scotty was re-elected to the presidency in 2004.
As president, Nauru's constitution stipulates that Mr Stephen will be both head of state and head of government on the island.

But as the European population burgeoned, tensions - often over the loss of land - rose between the incomers and the indigenous Melanesians, known as Kanaks. A Kanak revolt in 1878 claimed more than 1,000 lives and heralded further repression by the French rulers.
Kanaks represent about 45% of the population. Europeans, most of them born in the territory, account for about a third of the inhabitants.
Rising pro-independence sentiment among the Kanaks, and strong resistance to the idea among the non-indigenous population, set the scene for violent unrest in the mid-1980s. At one stage France declared a state of emergency and sent paratroopers.
Mangroves fringe much of New Caledonia's coastline
The signing of the 1988 Matignon Accord marked a reconciliation between the Kanak and European communities. It proposed an end to direct rule from Paris and a vote on independence, to be held in 1998. It also set out to tackle the economic imbalance between the wealthier - and mainly European - southern province and the rest of the territory.
However, the planned referendum was postponed under the 1998 Noumea Accord, which gave New Caledonia greater autonomy and stipulated that the independence vote should be held between 2014 and 2019. The accord also created New Caledonian citizenship.
In 2006 the French parliament approved plans to restrict the voting rights of French citizens in the territory, meaning that only long-standing residents would be able to vote in territorial elections. The legislation had long been sought by the Kanak community.
The archipelago, which lies around 2,000 km from Sydney, Australia, possesses around a quarter of the world's nickel deposits. The industry boomed in the 1960s but is a hostage to price fluctuations. Nevertheless, New Caledonia enjoys one of the region's highest average incomes per capita.
The main island, Grande Terre, is ringed by a coral reef. Mountains divide the verdant east from a drier west. The territory boasts abundant plant and animal life. Colonial buildings and fine beaches contrast with the infrastructure of the nickel industry.

Aside from defence matters and foreign relations, Niue runs its own affairs. All Niueans are New Zealand citizens and can take up residency there.
The long-running population decline was aggravated by Cyclone Heta, which devastated the island in 2004. Some observers fear that the community's viability is threatened by migration.

Technology-savvy Niue has embraced the internet. It earns money from the sale of its suffix and in 2003 it became the first territory to offer a free wireless internet service to all residents.
Lying between Tonga and the Cook Islands, Niue was settled by Samoans in the first century AD. Britain's Captain James Cook sighted the island in 1774, dubbing it ""Savage Island"" after locals thwarted his landing attempts.
British missionaries arrived in the 19th century and the island was subsequently administered from New Zealand. Niueans voted to become self-governing in 1974.

The industry was dealt a blow in 2005 when, under liberalised world trade rules, the US scrapped import quotas on Chinese-made garments.
Economic woes were compounded when, months later, Japan Airlines ended flights to the territory, hitting the tourist trade.
Spain proclaimed sovereignty in the 16th century. The diseases brought by the early European settlers decimated the indigenous population. The islands came under German, and then Japanese, control in the 20th century.
The islands saw some of the heaviest fighting in the Pacific during World War II. Japan lost control of the main island, Saipan, after US forces invaded in June 1944. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians perished in the bitterly-fought campaign.
The battle for Saipan was a turning point in the Pacific war, allowing the island of Tinian to become a staging post for the 1945 US atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
After the war, the Northern Marianas were governed by Washington as a UN-mandated Pacific trust territory. The islands sought political union with the US in the mid-1970s. CNMI residents are US citizens. The territory receives millions of dollars in aid from Washington.

President: Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino
When the 50-year-old Benigno Aquino won the 2010 presidential election, he was at that stage better known for his parents than for any of his own achievements.
Until he ran for president, Noynoy Aquino was relatively unknown
But the fact his mother was the former President Cory Aquino and his father the pro-democracy hero Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino meant that he was virtually predestined for a career in public life.
During the election campaign, Mr Aquino - who is more commonly known as Noynoy - underlined his desire to emulate his mother by carrying on her pro-democracy agenda.
His other main campaign pledge was to combat corruption, and he suggested that he had some very powerful people in his sights. He has indicated that he even plans to have his predecessor Gloria Arroyo investigated for alleged vote-rigging in the 2004 presidential election - an accusation she denies.
His campaign slogan - ""When no one's corrupt, no one will be poor"" - linked corruption in high places with the grinding poverty endured by many of his compatriots. A third of the 90 million population lives on just one US dollar a day.
Another challenge he will face is the high level of localised violence, particularly on the southern island of Mindanao, where the armed forces are fighting both Islamic and communist rebels. The Arroyo administration had been engaged in peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and he has vowed to continue these.
But perhaps Mr Aquino's greatest challenge will be to step out of the shadow of his famous family.
The only son of Cory and Ninoy Aquino, Noynoy Aquino studied economics before starting a career in business. His father was murdered when he returned to the Philippines from exile in 1983. Four years later, Noynoy himself was seriously injured during the first coup attempt against his mother, who had become president in 1986.
He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, and became a senator in 2007.

And in June 2010, the two countries signed an historic trade pact that was described by some analysts as the most significant agreement in 60 years of separation.
Mr Ma's predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, had angered China with moves towards formal independence, and relations had been severely strained.
Despite the recent thaw, Taiwanese officials complain that Beijing has kept increasing the number of short-range missiles aimed at Taiwan.
In the past the military threat from the mainland has been partly offset by the pivotal relationship between Taipei and Washington, which is the main weapons supplier to the island - one of the world's biggest buyers of arms.
China was particularly angered by an arms deal agreed between Taiwan and the US in January 2010.
Diplomatic isolation
Taipei 101 was the world's  tallest building from 2004 until 2010
China insists that nations cannot have official relations with both China and Taiwan, with the result that Taiwan has formal diplomatic ties with only two dozen countries - Pacific, South American and African states in the main.
Taiwan has no seat at the United Nations, having lost it to China in 1971. Repeated attempts to regain representation at the UN have been blocked.
Despite its diplomatic isolation, Taiwan has become one of Asia's big traders. It is considered to have achieved an economic miracle, becoming one of the world's top producers of computer technology.
And past tensions notwithstanding, Taiwan and China enjoy healthy trade links. China is Taipei's number one export market.
For decades, the island was an authoritarian one-party state ruled by the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT), which under President Chiang Kai-shek controlled much of China before the Communists' rise to power in 1949.

In the early 1990s, however, Taiwan made the transition to democracy and the KMT's monopoly on power ended completely in 2000, with the election of President Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Unlike the KMT, which seeks a united, non-Communist China, Mr Chen was a passionate supporter of complete secession, straining relations with Beijing.
Although he won a second term in 2004, persistent corruption allegations surrounding the president and his family undermined Mr Chen's popularity, and contributed to the DPP's loss to a resurgent KMT in the 2008 presidential election.

The country's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of Tajikistan's GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Russian forces guarded sections of the border with Afghanistan until mid-2005 when their withdrawal was completed and the task handed over to Tajik border guards.
Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
In October 2004 Russia formally opened a military base in Dushanbe where several thousand troops will be stationed. It also took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre at Nurek.

Head of state:
King Bhumibol Adulyadej
Thailand is a constitutional monarchy.
Its king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, assumed the throne in June 1946 and is the world's longest-reigning monarch.
The royal family is revered by many Thais.
Prime minister: Abhisit Vejjajiva
Abhisit Vejjajiva defeated an ally of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a parliamentary vote to become Thailand's fifth head of government in a little over two years.
Abhisit Vejjajiva is supported by Thailand's educated middle classes
Mr Abhisit's election marked the first time his Democrat Party - Thailand's oldest - had formed a government in eight years.
The vote was the result of weeks of manoeuvring to persuade several minor parties which had supported the previous government to switch sides.
Mr Abhisit's predecessor, Somchai Wongsawat, an ally of Mr Thaksin, was forced from office in December 2008 by a Constitutional Court ruling that disbanded his People Power Party and barred its leaders from politics for five years.
The ruling came after months of protests by opponents of Mr Thaksin and his allies that closed the country's two main airports.
The protesters said the previous two years' governments were proxies for the discredited Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has fled Thailand to escape corruption charges.
Mr Abhisit, 44, comes from a wealthy family of Thai-Chinese origins, and was educated at England's top public school, Eton, and Oxford University.
He joined the Democrats in 1992, at the age of 27, becoming its leader in 2005.
His supporters are mainly from Thailand's educated middle class, unlike former PM Thaksin Shinawatra and his allies, who draw their support from working class and rural Thais.
After his election, he said one of his main aims was to re-establish ""national harmony"" after the deeply polarising politics of recent years.
But the deep divisions within Thai society were once more highlighted when anti-government protesters stormed the venue of an ASEAN summit in the resort of Pattaya in April 2009, forcing the cancellation of the summit.
A year later, in March and April 2010, pro-Thaksin protesters wearing their signature red shirts mounted an even more serious challenge to Mr Abhisit, paralysing large sections of central Bangkok for two months to demand he step down and call early elections.
Mr Abhisit appeared to give way by promising to bring forward elections to November, but talks ended in deadlock. In early May, accusing the demonstrators of terrorism, the government ordered in the army, dispersing the protests after five days of clashes which left at least 37 people dead and scores more injured.

International attention was focused on the territory in 2008 during the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Fatal clashes between anti-Chinese protesters and the authorities in Tibet were given wide publicity and the torch relay in London, Paris and San Francisco was dogged by pro-Tibet protests and stunts.
AT A GLANCE
Sovereignty: The Dalai Lama says Tibet was independent and has been colonised. China says its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries.
What is Tibet? China considers this to be the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Dalai Lama says it should include neighbouring provinces with Tibetan populations.
Repression: Dalai Lama says 1.2 million people were killed under Chinese rule. China disputes this.
Culture: Dalai Lama says China actively suppressed Tibetan identity. China acknowledges some abuses but says it is helping the revival of Tibetan culture.
Development: China says it has brought improvements in health and the economy. Dalai Lama says development has favoured Han Chinese immigrants.
International response: No country openly disputes China's claim to sovereignty, and China has blocked all UN resolutions on Tibet.
The free-Tibet movement: The Tibetan cause has won the sympathy of individuals and groups, many of whom campaign for an independent Tibet.
Q&A: China and Tibet
Tibet has had a tumultuous history, during which it has spent some periods functioning as an independent entity and others ruled by powerful Chinese and Mongolian dynasties.
China sent in thousands of troops to enforce its claim on the region in 1950. Some areas became the Tibetan Autonomous Region and others were incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces.
In 1959, after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and set up a government in exile in India. Most of Tibet's monasteries were destroyed in the 1960s and 1970s during China's Cultural Revolution. Thousands of Tibetans are believed to have been killed during periods of repression and martial law.
Under international pressure, China eased its grip on Tibet in the 1980s, introducing ""Open Door"" reforms and boosting investment.
Beijing says Tibet has developed considerably under its rule. But rights groups say China continues to violate human rights, accusing Beijing of political and religious repression. Beijing denies any abuses.
Tourism and the ongoing modernisation drive stand in contrast to Tibet's former isolation. But Beijing's critics say Tibetans have little say in building their future.
China says a new railway link between Lhasa and the western Chinese province of Qinghai will boost economic expansion. The link is likely to increase the influx of Chinese migrants.
Buddhism reached Tibet in the seventh century. The Dalai Lama, or Ocean of Wisdom, is the leading spiritual figure; the Panchen Lama is the second most important figure. Both are seen as the reincarnations of their predecessors.
The selection of a Dalai Lama and a Panchen Lama has traditionally followed a strict process. But the Dalai Lama and Beijing are at odds over the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama, having identified different youngsters for the role. The Dalai Lama's choice, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, has not been seen since his detention by the Chinese authorities in 1995.
Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, leads a government in exile
There have been intermittent and indirect contacts between China and the Dalai Lama. The exiled spiritual leader advocates a non-violent, negotiated solution to the Tibet problem and accepts the notion of real autonomy for Tibet under Chinese sovereignty. China has questioned his claims that he does not seek independence.
Tibet's economy depends largely on agriculture. Forests and grasslands occupy large parts of the country. The territory is rich in minerals, but poor transport links have limited their exploitation. Tourism is an important revenue earner.

Most of the 1,500 islanders live by subsistence farming. Thousands have chosen to leave, usually for New Zealand or Samoa. The latter has a similar culture and language.
The UN has earmarked Tokelau as one of a number of territories where it wants to encourage greater independence. However, Tokelauans voted in February 2006 to retain their colonial status, rather than to take on greater autonomy.
Tokelau has few resources apart from its fishing grounds, but makes some money from the sale of fishing rights and the use of its internet domain. New Zealand provides around 80% of the territory's budget and has tried to allay fears that it will abandon the atolls should Tokelau become autonomous.
Emigrants from other Polynesian islands were the first settlers. Nineteenth-century whalers and missionaries were among the first European visitors to Tokelau, formerly known as the Union Islands.
The atolls became a British protectorate in the late 19th century and for a time were part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. New Zealand administered Tokelau from 1926.
Like other low-lying Pacific territories, Tokelau is said to be at risk from rising sea levels. It is also vulnerable to tropical cyclones.
In July 2009 Tokelau announced its ambition to become completely energy self-sufficient in a year's time. Tokelau's Ulu (leader), Foua Toloa, said that ""we'll try to beat every nation in the world to become the first country to be energy renewable, completely run by solar power and a little bit of coconut oil.""

Head of state: King George Tupou V
King George Tupou V was sworn in during a brief ceremony in September 2006, succeeding his father King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV when he died after a long illness. The new king's coronation took place in August 2008.
King George Tupou V says he is committed to reform
King Tupou says he is committed to economic development and democratic reform.
Following the pro-democracy riots in November 2006, the government agreed to hold elections in 2010 in which a majority of the parliament will be directly elected by a popular vote.
Tupou V owns some of Tonga's biggest businesses, including the island's only power company, a brewery and a mobile phone company. The palace says the king has started to divest himself of his commercial interests.
The King was educated in New Zealand, Switzerland and Britain. A bachelor with no legitimate children, he has named his younger brother as heir apparent. He is known for his liking for wearing military uniforms and for driving around in a London taxi.
Prime minister: Feleti Sevele
One of Tonga's few elected rather than appointed politicians and a long-standing advocate of more democracy, Feleti Sevele was made the country's first non-noble prime minister after six months of public protests demanding a smaller role for the royal family in government.

His predecessor, 'Ulukalala Lavaka Ata, was a member of the royal family.
An economist and mathematician by training, Mr Sevele previously served as minister of trade and labour and negotiated Tonga's membership of the World Trade Organisation.
He said his appointment showed that the monarchy was ready to change. King Tupou V announced shortly after his coronation in August 2008 that he was transferring the day-to-day running of the government to Prime Minister Sevele ahead of the 2010 elections.

Despite its gas wealth, much of Turkmenistan's population is still impoverished. After independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 the country entered a period of isolation that has only recently begun to end.
It is a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, which was led by the President Saparmurat Niyazov until his death in December 2006.
The late leader styled himself Turkmenbashi, or Father of the Turkmen, and made himself the centre of an omnipresent personality cult. Mr Niyazov, who made himself president for life in 1999, spent large sums of public money on grandiose projects while heavily cutting social welfare.
Presidential palace in Ashgabat, built by late President Niyazov
His influence spread into every area of life in the republic. Turkmens were even expected to take spiritual guidance from his book, Ruhnama, a collection of thoughts on Turkmen culture and history.
His successor, Kurbanguly Berdymuhamedov, said he would follow in Mr Niyazov's footsteps, but increasingly showed signs of a different approach. He eschews the pomp that accompanied his predecessor's public appearances and has set about dismantling the Niyazov cult.
Turkmenistan is the most ethnically homogeneous of the Central Asian republics. There are some Uzbeks in the east, as well as small populations of Russians, Kazakhs, Tatars and others.
In contrast to other former Soviet republics, it has been largely free of inter-ethnic hostilities. However, strong tribal allegiances among the Turkmen can be a source of tension.
With foreign investors keeping away, the Turkmen economy remains underdeveloped.
The country has been unable to benefit fully from its gas and oil deposits because of an absence of export routes and a dispute between the Caspian Sea littoral states over the legal status of offshore oil.
Turkmenistan produces roughly 70 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year and about two-thirds of its exports go to Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly. A protracted dispute between the two countries over the price ended in September 2006 when Gazprom agreed to pay 54% more.
Turkmenistan has since made efforts to break out of Russia's hold on its exports. It has opened major gas pipelines to China and Iran, and is considering taking part in the Nabucco pipeline - an EU-backed project designed to provide an alternative to Russian gas supplies to Europe.

Life on the islands is simple and often harsh. There are no streams or rivers, so the collection of rain is essential.
Coconut palms cover most of the islands, and copra - dried coconut kernel - is practically the only export commodity. Increasing salination of the soil threatens traditional subsistence farming.
Three-storey government HQ: Tuvalu's tallest building
Tuvalu depends on foreign aid, the income from the sale of tuna fishing licences and the interest from a trust fund set up in 1987. The sale of postage stamps also brings in revenues.
It is one of a handful of countries to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which has funded the construction of Tuvalu's largest building - a three-storey administrative headquarters.
Tuvalu has shown ingenuity by exploiting another source of income. It has sold its internet suffix - .tv - to a Californian company for several million dollars a year in continuing revenue. The company sells the suffix on to television broadcasters.
Some of the money has been used to pave roads - which were formerly made of crushed coral - and to build schools.

Economics: Uzbekistan is a leading cotton grower. Natural gas is a big attraction abroad. Central control of the economy dates back to the Soviet era.
International: Despite frequent criticism of its poor human rights record, Uzbekistan's energy resources and strategic location have led both Russia and the West to seek closer ties.
Timeline
The country is one of the world's biggest producers of cotton and is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold. However, economic reform has been slow and poverty and unemployment are widespread.
Following the 11 September attacks on the US, Uzbekistan won favour with Washington by allowing its forces a base in Uzbekistan, affording ready access across the Afghan border.
Human rights groups accused the international community of ignoring the many reported cases of abuse and torture.
Since independence, the country has faced sporadic bombings and shootings, which the authorities have been quick to blame on Islamic extremists.
In May 2005, troops in the eastern city of Andijan opened fire on protesters demonstrating against the imprisonment of people charged with Islamic extremism. Witnesses reported a bloodbath with several hundred civilian deaths. The Uzbek authorities say fewer than 190 died.
Opponents of President Karimov blamed the authorities' brutal determination to crush all dissent. The president blamed fundamentalists seeking to overthrow the government and establish a Muslim caliphate in Central Asia.
The government's reaction to the Andijan unrest prompted strong criticism from the West, and relations cooled. In response, Uzbekistan expelled US forces from their base and moved closer to Russia, with Mr Karimov at one point describing it as Tashkent's ""most reliable partner and ally"".
From 2008 onwards, ties with the West began improving again, spurred on by Europeans' search for alternative energy sources in Central Asia and Uzbekistan's strategic importance for the anti-Taliban operation in Afghanistan.
The EU eased sanctions imposed after the Andijan killings, and the World Bank reversed a decision to suspend loans to Uzbekistan. In 2009 the EU lifted its arms embargo.
At the same time, relations with Moscow became less warm, with Uzbekistan in 2009 criticising plans for a Russian base in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.
President Karimov's uncompromising policies have also at times created friction between Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries, and Uzbekistan has been wary of moves towards closer political integration.

Xinjiang, about the size of Iran, is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range.
The economy of this once agricultural region has developed fast since 1949, and oil and petrochemicals now account for about 60 per cent of its GDP. It is also an important trade and pipeline route into Central Asia and beyond.
The region was contested by various Turkic groups, Mongols and the Chinese until the 18th century, when the Chinese Qing Dynasty brought the whole area under its control.
Russia's conquest of the neighbouring Central Asian states of Kokand and Bukhara led to a renewed struggle for control over the area, with the Kokand general Yaqub Bek establishing a de facto independent state in Kashgar in 1865. China gradually regained control of the region and formally set up Xinjiang Province in 1884.
Russian influence remained strong, especially during the rule of various warlords after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. The Soviet Union supported an Uighur-led separatist East Turkestan Republic in the north of the region in 1944-1949, but helped to extinguish it when the Communists took over in China proper.

Views from China
Communist China established the Autonomous Region in 1955, and began to encourage Han Chinese to settle there in new industrial towns and farming villages run by the quasi-military Xinjiang Production and Development Corps. China also set up its nuclear testing facility at Lop Nur in the Tarim Basin, conducting the first test there in 1964.
In the 2000 census Han Chinese made up 40 per cent of the population of Xinjiang, excluding large numbers of troops stationed in the region and unknown numbers of unregistered migrants, and Uighurs accounted for about 45 per cent.
Ethnic unrest
International attention turned to Xinjiang in July 2009 when bloody clashes between Uighurs and Han Chinese in the region's main city, Urumqi, promoted the Chinese government to send large numbers of troops to patrol the streets. Nearly 200 people were killed in the unrest, most of them Han, according to officials.
Protests against Chinese rule had already emerged in the 1990s, to which the Chinese authorities reacted forcefully. These culminated in clashes in the city of Yining (Ghulja in Uighur) in 1997 in protest at the execution of 30 alleged separatists. The authorities reported nine dead in the violence, although separatists said more than a hundred protestors were killed.
Protests resumed in March 2008 in the cities of Urumqi and Hotan, and spread to Kashgar and elsewhere through the summer - coinciding with the Olympic Games in Beijing. There were reports of bus bombings and attacks on police stations.
The main Uighur groups abroad are the separatist East Turkestan Liberation Movement, founded in Turkey in the late 1990s, and the World Uighur Congress, which was set up in Germany in 2004.
The latter is led by Rebiya Kadeer, a businesswoman and politician who broke with Beijing over the Ghulja clashes in 1997 and spent years in prison before being allowed to emigrate in 2005. China has said the ""East Turkestan Islamic Movement"" is behind separatist attacks, but exiled Uighurs and independent specialists on the area have cast doubt on whether such an organisation exists.

The youngest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has been appointed to two key party posts, in a move widely seen as part of a gradual transfer of power.
Kim Jong-un was named vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party and was appointed to its central committee, state media said.
Kim Jong-il, thought to be in poor health, was re-elected as leader at the party's first congress for 30 years.
But as John Simpson reports from neighbouring South Korea, events in Pyongyang have been shrouded in secrecy.

138;"In pictures: North Korea parade
They were announced with suitable deference on state TV, but among a batch of promotions of other apparatchiks and with no mention of Kim Jong-un's special family connection.
In the outside world though, the ranks of North Korea-watchers - the pundits, academics and foreign intelligence agencies - are greatly excited.
""It's clearly the biggest news we've had from North Korea since the death of Kim Il-sung,"" Peter Beck, a North Korea expert now based at Japan's Keio University told the Associated Press.
The country's ruling family appears to have its strategy for continuing its quasi-religious leadership cult all worked out.
Kim Jong-il's influential sister, Kim Kyong-hui, attended the conference, having also been promoted to the rank of military general.
It is thought that the title will be a token of added authority, helping her to steer her young nephew through the early days of the transition.
The few still photographs released so far from the conference hall show Kim Jong-il apparently chairing proceedings.
That, at least, confirms that, although thin and frail, he is well enough to attend and seemingly still in control.
But some observers detect a sense of sudden urgency about what's been going on, suggesting that the leader might be in even poorer health than he looks.
Kim Jong-un, then, may find himself in charge sooner rather than later.
Weighty legacy
So what kind of leader would he be? It's a hard question to answer.
Outside North Korea, very little is known about him, even what he looks like is unclear.

Footage aired on state-run TV showed Kim Jong-un at the Workers' Party Conference
The few photographs that exist are grainy images from his teenage years.
One widely reported detail from his scant biography suggests that he spent a few school years studying in Switzerland under an assumed name, a travel privilege, of course, denied to the vast majority of his fellow North Koreans.
But perhaps the exposure to Western culture will mean he'll be more reform-minded than his father - after all, he is said by former classmates to have been an avid fan of the American NBA basketball league.
But it's also been pointed out that, for example, many of the Middle Eastern oil sheikhs had an expensive Western schooling and it hasn't turned them into liberal democrats.
Professor Andrei Lankov from Seoul's Kookmin University believes that Kim Jong-un's lack of experience is precisely why he has been chosen as heir apparent.
""People around Kim Jong-il want him to be replaced by an obedient leader when he dies, a sort of rubber-stamp dictator,"" he told me.
""People who are now running the country want to stay in control, they want a weak successor, and he seems to be the weakest of all possible candidates right now.""
If Kim Jong-un is to become little more than a puppet, with an elite family and military clique pulling strings behind the scenes, then that also raises the prospect of factionalism and infighting further down the road.
And that's a worrying prospect for North Korea's neighbours who are watching carefully as events unfold.
Whatever the future holds, at least one mystery has been solved fairly quickly.
The first official photograph has finally been released, apparently giving the world its first up-to-date glimpse of the young man who has just been handed a very weighty legacy indeed.

They were the last Buddhist family in the Muslim village where they had lived for decades, but their neighbours and friends could not stop the armed militia who came just after dark.
In six years of violence 4,300 people have been killed and 7,000 injured after a dormant separatist movement came to life in the deep south of Thailand on the Malaysian border.
The three modern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala used to be the historic Sultanate of Patani, officially absorbed into Thailand in 1909.
Despite Thailand's policy of unity among its various ethnic groups, many people here see themselves as Malay Muslim, or ""Malayu"" first and Thai second, speaking a Patani dialect and with a written language using Arabic script.
Hearts and minds
Every morning at around 0830 the children at Baan Taba school, in Narathiwat gather on the dusty playing field to sing the national anthem as the Thai flag is raised.
The teachers are Buddhists, lessons are in Thai but the pupils are Malay Muslim
The teachers are Buddhists and lessons are in Thai, but all the pupils are Malay Muslim.
""The kids feel they are Malayu - it's their language they use in their communities, but the government sees that Malayu is taught at private Islamic schools so it's not emphasised it in state schools,"" said Sangaun Inrak, president of the provincial teachers' federation.
""Up to now 137 teachers have been killed in the three southern provinces. The reason we become the target is because the militants' aim is to destroy the education system, which they believe will decrease people's confidence in the central government.""
In the 1960s and 1970s separatists fought a guerrilla war against the Thai authorities, but by the 1980s military action, an amnesty and clever politics stopped the fighting.
But as the twin towers fell, a separatist movement was stirring again, based on an increasingly Islamic, but equally cultural and ethnic, identity and it erupted into life in 2004 with the storming of an army base.
Development projects aim to win the 'hearts and minds' of locals and isolate the militants
Brutal military action to crush the militants backfired, handing them a propaganda victory as troops killed separatists inside a mosque and then dozens of arrested protesters suffocated after being piled up in the back of military trucks with their hands tied.
The violence has declined since, but on average there are still two incidents every day, be it bombings or shootings, despite the almost 30,000 troops and 20,000 police sent to secure the area.
""I think our counter-insurgency strategy is actually gaining the support of the people with the two aims of protecting them and development trying to build a better future,"" said Songwit Noonpackdee, Deputy Commander of the Narathiwat Task Force.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year on development projects aimed at trying to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the people in order to isolate the militants, but he admits it is not the only solution.
""In finding a political solution we need to talk and we need to listen to many groups including the people who are in this area.""
New generation
The big problem is the groups never say who is responsible for attacks and the only evidence of what they want are from leaflets they leave behind.
They operate in small cells without clear leadership or co-ordinated structure, but talks have been going on with some of them, and with the groups who operated in the 1960s and 70s.
Srisompob Jitpiromsri says some form of autonomy is needed to solve the problem
Their ability to have any command or control over the new generation is questioned. They are now recruited along more radical Islamist, rather than purely separatist, rhetoric and attack civilians and Muslims as well as Buddhists.
Some say the old guard are no longer relevant, but Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch which monitors the violence, believes they need to be part of the dialogue.
""Many of the local units make independent decisions to carry out attacks any time, so it is very difficult, even amongst themselves, to control the activities on the ground.""
He says a deal will only be done if the Thai government gives ground to appease the majority and isolate the violent minority.
""Some form of autonomy should be considered as another factor to solve the problem. We might use the model England used for Northern Ireland. It doesn't threaten the unitary state.""
At Pattani central mosque the imam says most people do not want to be independent of Thailand, but he asks ""What have the government ever given us? Why do we not get justice from the government?""
The perception is a lack of respect for Malay Muslim identity, culture and traditions.
If the government can change that, the extremists may find their arguments for separatism being diluted and their campaign of violence becoming increasingly isolated among the people.

China tycoon pledges fortune to charity
US billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are hosting a dinner in Beijing for some of China's richest individuals.
They are hoping to learn about philanthropy in China - and perhaps persuade some of their guests to give more to charity. The BBC's Michael Bristow spoke to one of those invited to dine.
Mr Chen says he learned about charity mainly from the example set by his mother
Businessman Chen Guangbiao has been inspired by the two US billionaires.
The 42-year-old is a well-known philanthropist, but decided to go one step further when he got a call from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
Mr Chen sat down and wrote them a letter declaring that all his money will go to charity after he dies.
Perhaps surprisingly, the news was not greeted with universal approval in China, where giving to charity is not as established as in other countries.
There was particular criticism when people found out that Mr Chen does not even give money to his own siblings.
His sister earns 1,800 yuan ($270, £170) a month washing dishes in a hotel; his brother earns only slightly more working as a security guard.
On that issue, Mr Chen is unrepentant. He said he had helped them in the past, but they had squandered his money.
He said his brother gambled and his sister began a loan business that eventually failed.
""I'm determined never to help them again,"" he told the BBC in an interview at his plush Beijing apartment.
Entrepreneurial spirit
Chen Guangbiao's story is a classic tale of rags to riches.
He was born into a poor family in Anhui Province, where it was a constant battle to survive. He said two of his siblings died of starvation.
Mr Chen is not shy about telling people about his charity work
But from an early age Mr Chen began to understand two things that have guided him throughout his adult life: business and charity.
As a schoolboy he soon amassed what was to him a small fortune by selling anything he could - water, ice-cream - and doing odd jobs.
He has worked hard ever since, claiming never to have had a day off since he founded his company, Huangpu Renewable Resources, in 1998.
His firm recycles waste material from the construction industry, and has allowed Mr Chen to amass a fortune estimated at $440m.
Charity was the second idea that the businessman learned about early, mainly from the example set by his mother.
""When other people's kids had no milk, my mother would breastfeed them herself,"" said the businessman.
She also invited beggars into their home to share their meagre meals.
Mr Chen's first experience of helping others came as a youngster when he handed over his hard-earned money to pay for a neighbour's school fees.
The father of two said giving was a habit he has maintained over the years.
Inspired
A report on philanthropy in China published by the Shanghai-based Huran Research Institute earlier this year listed Mr Chen as the country's fourth-most-generous giver.
It said he had donated $130m over the last five years to projects involved in health-care, disaster relief and education.
But the Giving Pledge campaign started by Mr Gates and Mr Buffett has pushed Mr Chen to donate even more money.
This campaign urges US billionaires to give away more than half their wealth to charitable causes.
Mr Chen said this inspired him to announce he would give all his money away when he died.
His philosophy can be summed up in a passage from the letter he wrote to the American philanthropists telling them of his intention.
""If you have only a glass of water then one person can drink. If you have a bucket a whole family can benefit.""
He added: ""If you have a river, then you should share it with everyone.""
Mr Chen is not shy about telling people about his charity work.
""Society needs hundreds of hundreds of thousands of Chen Guangbiaos,"" he wrote in another letter published on his company's website.
He admits that he is brash - but he believes that is the only way to encourage more people to give to charity.

142;"Country profile: Tajikistan
In the last sunshine of the day, hundreds of mainly young men in crisp white shirts line up in orderly rows.
Very few of them have jobs. And for most, the only realistic prospect of making some money is to go to Russia, where there are now hundreds of thousands of Tajiks doing so-called ""3D jobs"" - dirty, difficult and dangerous.
For some of these young people, though, Friday prayers at the local mosque are not enough.
Internet Islam
Curiosity about Islam has led them to internet cafes, where they have quickly tapped into a darker world.
Furqon.com is the website of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an al-Qaeda-affiliated Central Asian group that now fights alongside the Taliban from a base in northern Pakistan.
Written in local and Arabic languages, it offers a mix of Islamic texts, atrocity videos and exhortations to join the jihad.
It is dangerous material in the hands of disaffected teenagers looking for something to believe in.
""My 17-year-old nephew thinks 9/11 was organised by the Israeli and US secret services,"" says a local journalist who has been following the rising popularity of militant sites.
""Recently, I found a picture of Osama Bin Laden on his phone…Where do you think he is getting that kind of propaganda from? Certainly not from our village mullah, who doesn't know much about either country.""
Of course, it is a big step from reading radical websites to taking up arms against the government. But it is evident that militant groups operating inside and outside Central Asia see poverty-stricken and fragile Tajikistan as a weak spot in the regional armour.
Over the past 18 months there have been reports of IMU fighters moving across Afghanistan into the northern districts bordering Tajikistan.
In early September, IMU fighters were involved in a violent jail break in Dushanbe that left six prison guards dead.
They are also thought to be behind last week's attack on a Tajik army convoy in a remote eastern area which killed at least 25 soldiers.
These incidents are just the latest in a string of militant attacks across Tajikistan in the past year.
Hardening resolve
The government's response has been to crack down on the Islamists. Hundreds of young people have been arrested and jailed, and some allegedly subjected to brutal treatment.
But the hardline approach does not seem to be working.
If anything, it is only hardening the resolve of a new generation who sees their government as corrupt and morally bankrupt, and Islam as the only real alternative.
Despite his time in prison, Bahrom has no intention of giving up his struggle.
""In prison I was really free. I had time to learn about the Koran and Arabic,"" he says.
""More and more people are coming to join our cause. If they arrest one of us, four new people will join. It will never stop.""

143;"Indonesia: 17.8%
Sources: UN, World Bank, CIA World Factbook
Nigeria was formed by Britain as two separate protectorates in 1900, and brought together as one in 1914.
Its close to 150 million people speak numerous languages, follow two major world religions and many more indigenous beliefs.
My own grandfather first arrived in Nigeria in the colonial days in 1928. Over the years, he rose to be part of the team negotiating independence in the 1950s.
The way he and his colleagues framed the constitution probably set the country on the path to civil war. But the comparison with formerly Dutch-ruled Indonesia shows that colonial rule is not reason enough to explain the state of things today.
Nor is a fractured society when a country as diverse as Indonesia can do as well as it has. And nor is oil, for Indonesia has that too but has managed its resource relatively well.
So what explains the difference between them? I asked a friend, Bambang Harymurti, an Indonesian journalist.
""Struggle is the reason,"" he suggested. Though the regime struck out at those who opposed it, Indonesians had put their leaders under pressure, he said.
Fearing revolt
While lining his pockets handsomely, amassing a family fortune estimated at up to $35 billion, Indonesia's Suharto had tasked his economic advisers with keeping him in power. What he feared most was a popular revolt.
Since the Dutch first colonised Indonesia, popular movements had always pressured their leaders. In the 1920s, a major revolt had broken out against the Dutch. The revolt failed, but it led to change.
Then between 1945 and 1949, the Islamist, communist and nationalist movements that had formed fought a bloody rebellion to force the Japanese and then the Dutch out of the colony. They succeeded.
Nigeria's last presidential elections in 2007 were heavily criticised
So when Suharto took power in 1965, and though he ruled brutally, he was still fearful of an uprising and had reason to be so.
For decades, spurred on by Suharto, the economists ensured the economy grew fast enough to lift millions out of poverty.
The army - which bloodily suppressed rebellions in some regions - was used to build roads and bring electricity to the poor in the Indonesian heartlands.
The economy was diversified and oil money was used to build sectors such as agriculture and fisheries, tourism and manufacturing, to provide jobs and income. Indonesia, which was once a minor player, is today the world's largest producer of palm oil.
And these changes were made to provide the poor with jobs and income. Nigeria, which in the 1960s produced almost half the world's palm oil, now accounts for just 7%.
And Suharto was right to be fearful.
Feisty Nigeria
When the economy collapsed in the Asian financial crisis of 1997, popular resistance rose and he was forced from power.
The new rulers took note and the economy is growing again.
And in Nigeria? In Nigeria - feisty, fractious, exhilarating Nigeria - rebels in the Delta have staged attacks on oil wells.
Artists such as Fela Kuti and Wole Soyinka have railed at injustice. Civil rights groups have staged protests.
But if the songs and plays have been popular, the protests have, by and large, been attended by hundreds not tens of thousands.
So in Nigeria, leaders fear being usurped by each other and not ousted by a popular revolt. And they do not make things change.
""What I realised,"" Chukwudifu Oputa, the retired Supreme Court Justice selected in 1999 to look into human rights abuses under the military, told me one day, ""is we have not fought, not really, or not enough. And if you do not fight for your rights, nobody will fight for you.""
Nigerians fight every day, of course. They fight for survival, to put food on the table and to get by.
But have they put real pressure on their leaders?
If not, is that the reason, I wonder, that the average Nigerian lives to 47, and the average Indonesian to 70?
My Nigeria: Five decades of independence, by Peter Cunliffe-Jones was published this month by Palgrave Macmillan

Liu Tao weighed 40kg more than he should have before starting weight-loss treatment
The Aimin Fat Reduction Hospital in the Chinese city of Tianjin does not hide its aims behind an inoffensive name.
It currently has more than 100 patients, but only one goal - to get them to lose weight.
It is one of many hospitals, clinics and camps that have sprung up across China to help the country's growing army of overweight and obese citizens.
These people are more liable to suffer from a range of illnesses, and are already putting pressure on China's healthcare system.
Many countries have to cope with similar problems, but what is unusual in China is that there has been an explosion of obesity.
Just a generation ago, hardly anyone was overweight.
Elastic skin
Liu Tao is one of the hospital's day patients. He is only 12 years old, but weighed 115kg before he began his course of treatment.
That is about 40kg above what someone of his height should weigh.
His treatment includes a very Chinese approach to weight loss: he has regular sessions of acupuncture and massage.
The massage ensures that his skin remains elastic - so it will shrink along with his waistline.
The youngster made a good start, losing 9kg in just over two weeks.
Liu Tao's mum says he has always been bigger than other youngsters
China's family planning policies have been blamed for the growing number of overweight children.
Many families have just one child and some say these children are spoilt; Liu Tao is an only child and admits he used to eat whatever he wanted.
His mum, Su Jinna, has now put him on a new diet. Vast evening meals, sometimes including two helpings, have been replaced by fruit and vegetables.
When the BBC visited their Tianjin home, Liu Tao was served a melon and a bowl of boiled broccoli for dinner.
Did the youngster like it? ""It's awful. It's not sweet at all,"" he said
Getting people to stick to healthier diets is one of the problems identified by experts hoping to get overweight people to slim down.
Mrs Su also blames her son's weight on China's education system, which puts little emphasis on sporting activities.
""He leaves for school at seven every morning and doesn't get back until seven in the evening,"" she said.
""So after eating and finishing his homework it's 10 o'clock, and there's no time for anything else such as exercise.""
'Nowhere to exercise'
The rising number of overweight Chinese people is, in part, the result of the country's remarkable economic growth over the last 30 years.

Obesity has been linked to a range of illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
There are now thought to be more than 90 million diabetics in China - about one in 10 adults.
That is a problem for the whole of society, which will eventually have to pay more money to treat them.
""It will put a huge burden on the healthcare system because many of these illnesses require individual long-term expensive treatment,"" said Peter Ben Embarek, of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Not long ago, many Chinese people did not have enough to eat - some still do not.
Millions of people are thought to have died in a famine in the early 1960s.
But economic reforms have transformed the lives of the people who live here. Many are now richer than they every dreamed - and bigger than they ever thought.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — American officials pressed their Pakistani counterparts on Thursday to reopen a vital supply route for American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, as relations deteriorated after the fourth strike by coalition helicopters in a week killed three members of Pakistan ’s border force.

Workers unloaded a container from a truck carrying NATO supplies at a warehouse in Peshawar on Thursday, after Pakistan shut down the main land route for NATO supplies into Afghanistan.
The New York Times
Pakistan angrily closed the crossing to protest the strikes on its side of the border, leaving American officials to use meetings and phone calls to try to soothe relations and get the route reopened. Both sides indicated that they might be able to resolve the dispute with a joint investigation.
But the border closing, and the exceptional series of strikes by piloted aircraft, as opposed to drones , signaled a general increase in tensions between Pakistan and the United States, already uncomfortable allies that are pursuing competing interests in the Afghan war.
The C.I.A. carried out a record number of drone attacks inside Pakistan last month, and new reports surfaced this week of unlawful executions by the Pakistani Army in areas where it has opened operations against Taliban forces threatening the government.
The Pakistani offensives have not extended to North Waziristan, the prime stronghold of the insurgents who infiltrate Afghanistan, a growing source of frustration for American officials who face a deadline this year to show progress in the Afghan war.
“We are clearly in the phase of our relationship where we’re trying to tell them we’re being diddled,” said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
But, she added: “We have been trying for a couple of years to decrease our logistical dependence on Pakistan, and have only managed to get it to 80 percent from 90 percent. So, no, we clearly don’t have anyplace else to go.”
The border closing was a clear demonstration of the leverage Pakistan holds over the American war effort. It coincided with a previously scheduled visit by the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta , who met Thursday with the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , part of a stream of American officials who have come to alternately cajole and coerce Pakistani cooperation.
On Friday, unidentified assailants in Pakistan attacked and set fire to tankers carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan, officials told Reuters, apparently in retaliation for the incursions into Pakistani territory. No one was wounded, an official said.
After the border closing on Thursday, Senator John Kerry , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , trying to calm the tensions. That conversation followed a telephone call several days ago between Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and General Kayani, about the previous strikes.
The border closing signaled the limits of Pakistan’s tolerance for intrusions on its sovereignty and for the pressure it was willing to absorb from American officials on any range of issues, despite receiving nearly $2 billion a year in military aid from Washington.
The Pakistani government indicated Thursday that the cross-border strikes were more than it could bear without protest. “We will have to see whether we are allies or enemies,” said the Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik.
At the same time, Pakistani officials tried to contain the damage from a video that came to the attention of American officials in recent days showing the execution of six young men, bound and blindfolded, by Pakistani Army soldiers.
Responding to questions from American officials, Pakistani officials acknowledged Thursday that the video had not been faked, as they had first contended, an American official said, and that they had identified the soldiers and would take appropriate measures.
It is in both the American and the Pakistani interests to keep the relationship going, the official said. The Pakistanis, facing economic collapse after the devastating floods of the summer, need American military aid — some $10 billion since 2001 — which could be cut off from units committing atrocities, the official said.
American commanders are eager to continue C.I.A. drone attacks in Pakistan’s tribal areas that have focused on militants from the Taliban and Al Qaeda who cross the border to attack NATO and American troops. The Pakistani government has agreed to the drone campaign, but could always suspend its permission or shrink the area in which the strikes are allowed.
The country is also the prime supply route for the Afghan war, a fact Pakistani and American officials are both keenly aware of. The vast majority of nonlethal supplies — water, food, vehicles — for the coalition forces in landlocked Afghanistan must travel the length of Pakistan, from the southern port of Karachi to the Afghan border.
Along that route, trucks and fuel tankers have at times been hijacked and attacked by Taliban forces. Pakistani authorities have closed the border crossings only occasionally, however, usually citing security concerns.
But they have rarely appeared to hold up supplies in retaliation for NATO or American actions. In 2008, the Pakistanis closed the border crossing for several days after American aircraft bombed a Pakistani paramilitary post in Mohmand, another tribal area. Eleven Pakistanis were killed in the attack.
American commanders in Afghanistan, long fearful that Pakistan could choke off the supply route more permanently, have been seeking alternate paths through Central Asia, but with little success.
On Thursday, Pakistani officials gave them a glimpse of how much harder they could make the Afghan war. Trucks and oil tankers bound for coalition forces sat idle at the border post of Torkham, just north of Peshawar, with no word on when the post, one of two major land crossings to Afghanistan, would reopen, a Pakistani security official said.
But American officials noted that Pakistan had shut only one of several supply routes to Afghanistan, a sign that the Pakistani government wanted to minimize the episode’s fallout.
“We have many different capabilities, routes, ways to resupply, so there’s no immediate impact,” Col. Dave Lapan told reporters in Washington. The blocked route, the Khyber Pass, connects the frontier city of Peshawar to Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.
Colonel Lapan said American military officials were also looking into whether all procedures had been followed properly in the cross-border incidents. The Pakistani government took no similar action and made no such public protest after the earlier coalition airstrikes, even though they killed an estimated 55 people inside Pakistan.
Those strikes, on Sept. 24 and Sept. 25, took place on the border separating Khost Province in Afghanistan from North Waziristan. Coalition helicopters fired into Pakistan three times, with one helicopter briefly breaching Pakistani airspace, according to Maj. Sunset Belinsky, a NATO spokeswoman.
In the airstrike on Thursday, a NATO helicopter attacked a border post at Mandati Kandaw, a town close to Parachinar, in the Kurram tribal area, the Pakistani security official said. Three soldiers of Pakistan’s Frontier Corps were killed and three were wounded, he said.
Another border post, at Kharlachi, also in Kurram, was struck a few hours later, the official added. The two posts are about 15 miles apart and border Paktia Province, in Afghanistan.

146;"Generals in Pakistan Push for Shake-Up of Government (September 29, 2010)
The authenticity of the five-and-a-half-minute video, which shows the killing of the six men — some of whom appear to be teenagers, blindfolded, with their hands bound behind their backs — has not been formally verified by the American government. The Pakistani military said it was faked by militants.
But American officials, who did not want to be identified because of the explosive nature of the video, said it appeared to be credible, as did retired American military officers and intelligence analysts who have viewed it.
After viewing the graphic video on Wednesday, an administration official said: “There are things you can fake, and things you can’t fake. You can’t fake this.”
The director of the Central Intelligence Agency , Leon E. Panetta , who was in Islamabad on Wednesday on a previously scheduled visit, was expected to raise the subject of the video with the chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , and the head of the Pakistani spy agency, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha , American officials said.
The video adds to reports under review at the State Department and the Pentagon that Pakistani Army units have summarily executed prisoners and civilians in areas where they have opened offensives against the Taliban , administration officials said.
The video appears to have been taken in the Swat Valley , where the Pakistani military opened a campaign last year to push back Taliban insurgents. The effort was widely praised by American officials and financed in large part by the United States.
The reports could have serious implications for relations between the militaries. American law requires that the United States cut off financing to units of foreign militaries that are found to have committed gross violations of human rights.
But never has that law been applied to so strategic a partner as Pakistan , whose military has received more than $10 billion in American support since 2001 for its cooperation in fighting militants from the Taliban and Al Qaeda based inside the country.
The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, called the images “horrifying.” He said the American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, had raised the issue with the Pakistani government and was awaiting a response. “We are determined to investigate it,” he said.
The spokesman for the Pakistani Army, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, dismissed the video as part of a propaganda campaign by jihadists to defame the Pakistani Army. “No Pakistan Army soldier or officer has been involved in activity of this sort,” he said.
A senior Pakistani intelligence officer, who declined to be named, dismissed the video as a staged “drama.”
The Pakistani military came under strong pressure from the United States to make the drive into the Swat region. Having since expanded operations to South Waziristan, the military has found itself in a counterinsurgency campaign in which it has struggled to maintain local support and weed out insurgents and their sympathizers from the population.
The video, apparently taken surreptitiously with a cellphone, shows six young men being lined up near an abandoned building surrounded by  foliage. As the soldiers prepare to shoot, one soldier asks the commander, a heavily bearded man with the short hair typical of a military haircut: “One by one, or together?” He replies, “Together.”
A burst of gunfire erupts. The young men crumple to the ground. Some, still alive and wounded, groan. Then a soldier approaches the heap of bodies, and fires rounds into each man at short range to finish the job.
The men doing the shooting wear Pakistani Army uniforms and appear to be using G-3 rifles, standard issue for the Pakistani Army and rarely used by insurgents, according to several Pakistanis who watched the video.
The soldiers also speak Urdu, the language of the Pakistani Army, and use the word “Sahib” when addressing their commander, a polite form for Mr., which is uncommon among the Taliban.
The question of extrajudicial killings is particularly sensitive for Pentagon officials, who have tried in visits to Pakistan and through increased financing to improve their often-tense relationship with the Pakistani Army.
But growing word of such incidents in recent months has led to an internal debate at the State Department and the Pentagon over whether the reports are credible enough to warrant cutting off funds to Pakistani Army units, American officials said.

147;"The Lede Blog: Indian Judges Rule on a Matter of Faith (September 30, 2010)

The unorthodox decision by a three-judge panel in the state of Uttar Pradesh provided a Solomonic resolution — if one likely to be appealed to India’s Supreme Court — to a case the authorities had feared might unleash religious violence across India.
Nearly 200,000 state and federal officers were deployed across Uttar Pradesh as a precaution, as almost every major political figure in the nation, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , appealed for calm and harmony.
The case was considered especially combustible because the contested site, in the city of Ayodhya, was the scene of a searing act of religious violence in 1992 when Hindu extremists tore down an ancient mosque known as the Babri Masjid on the property. The destruction sparked riots that spilled into the following year and have been blamed for about 2,000 deaths.
Yet that violence did not repeat itself on Thursday evening, as the Indian public absorbed the ruling with a calm that leaders framed as evidence of the nation’s maturation and commitment to religious tolerance.
“I have full faith in the people of India,” Mr. Singh said in a statement issued after the decision, even as he cautioned against “mischief makers.” “I also have full confidence in the traditions of secularism, brotherhood and tolerance of our great country.”
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which rose to national prominence in the 1990s partly because of its advocacy of rebuilding a Hindu temple on the contested site, issued a statement Thursday praising the public’s controlled response as “a new chapter for national integration and a new era for intercommunity relations.”
“The B.J.P. is gratified that the nation has received the verdict with maturity,” the statement added.
The unexpected decision to divide the property initially suggested a political solution as much as a legal one. But Harish Salve, a former solicitor general of India, said the court had apparently based its decision on historical accounts suggesting that for centuries Hindus and Muslims had worshiped together at the site before they were segregated during British rule in the 1850s.
With this legacy, the court concluded that the entire property should be considered jointly held by Muslims and Hindus and distributed under relevant Indian property statutes, Mr. Salve said, which divide contested properties on the principle of fairness.
“It looks pretty good,” Mr. Salve said, rating the decision as “9 points out of 10.”
Under the court’s ruling, two-thirds of the land will go to Hindu groups while the remaining third will be awarded to Muslims. Lawyers for Hindus and for Muslims expressed dissatisfaction and promised to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
“There is no reason of any loss of hope,” said Zafaryab Jilana, a lawyer representing one of the Muslim parties to the case, speaking on national television. “We do not agree with the formula of giving one-third of the land to Muslims.”
The case required the judicial panel to wade deeply into India’s contested religious history. Lawyers for Hindu groups had argued that the Ayodhya site was the birthplace of one of Hinduism’s most revered deities, Ram. They contended that a temple to Ram had existed on the site until it was demolished to make way for the Babri Masjid, constructed in the 16th century by India’s first Mughal ruler.
Soon after the judges read the decision in a closed hearing, lawyers rushed to hundreds of reporters waiting outside the courthouse in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. “The judgment is in favor of Hindus,” said H. S. Jain, a lawyer for one of the Hindu groups in the case. “The belief of Hindus that this is the birthplace of Ram is upheld.”
But each of the three judges issued a separate opinion, diverging in interpretation of certain facts, including over whether Ram was born precisely on the contested site. Yet the court did hand a significant victory to Hindus, who had argued that Ram was born beneath the central dome of the destroyed structure. That portion of the contested property was granted to Hindus as part of their two-thirds share, presumably to erect a new temple to Ram.
The original case was filed in 1950 and then expanded over the years as more parties claimed title to the property. The Indian government now controls the property, and the court ordered that the status quo remain intact for the next three months. Assuming both sides follow through with filing appeals to the Supreme Court, the case could continue indefinitely.
The initial quiet public response was a relief to Indian officials. Earlier, Palaniappan Chidambaram, the home minister, had predicted that the public would respect the court’s finding.
“I think India has moved on, young people have moved on,” he told the Indian news media.
The oldest plaintiff, Hashim Ansari, 90, a Muslim tailor who had prayed at the Babri Masjid as a boy, said he would not take part in any appeal. He  joined the case in 1961 and had looked forward to a ruling as a matter of closure. He called Thursday’s decision a good judgment and hoped that efforts could soon begin to rebuild a mosque on the  land granted to Muslims.
Of course, he added, the timing will depend on appeals.
“It took 60 years to get this decision,” he said by telephone. “I do not know how many years the Supreme Court will take. At least I could hear this judgment on my own. Will I hear the Supreme Court judgment in my grave?”

KABUL, Afghanistan — With extraordinary effort, the Afghan government and Western aid programs have modestly reduced poppy cultivation in the country’s largest opium -producing province in the past year, but cultivation nationwide remained at last year’s levels and in two provinces increased sharply, according to the annual report released Thursday by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime .
Cultivation is a leading measure of farmers’ openness to growing alternative crops. Production, the other measure most frequently cited, was down sharply in the past year because of a blight that decreased the yield by 48 percent. Over all, that meant that Afghanistan produced almost 4,000 tons.  The information in the United Nations report is gathered by a combination of aerial surveillance and  on-the-ground interviews with farmers, security force members,  prosecutors and others who track narcotics.
In Helmand Province, cultivation dropped 7 percent. In a swath of land along the Helmand River Valley, where there has been an enormous focus by NATO troops and international reconstruction workers, the acreage open for cultivation of vegetables and staple crops increased somewhat, according to a counternarcotics expert from the British Embassy, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject.
Yury Fedotov, executive director of the United Nations agency, said, “This is good news, but there is no room for false optimism.”
The decrease in production appeared to be primarily the result of the blight, but it was a positive sign that the overall area under cultivation at least did not expand in the past year, according to Afghan and United Nations narcotics experts.
However, experts said they were worried that skyrocketing poppy prices could undercut the efforts to reduce cultivation in the coming year. The price farmers were paid by traffickers rose to about $58 per pound in 2010 from $22 per pound in 2009, making opium poppy a more attractive crop financially than alternatives like wheat in the impoverished rural areas of the country.
“The market may again become lucrative for poppy crop growers,” Mr. Fedotov said.
Helmand was the brightest spot in the main southern and western poppy-growing regions. In neighboring Kandahar Province, cultivation rose 30 percent, and in Farah Province cultivation was up 17 percent.
Almost all cultivation took place in nine provinces in the southern and western region, which are among Afghanistan’s least secure. Twenty of the country’s 34 provinces are poppy free, and that number has now held steady for two years.
“Ninety-eight percent of poppy cultivation takes place in the provinces where security is not good,” said Zarar Ahmad Muqbil, the Afghan minister for counternarcotics.
Diplomats who track poppy production attribute the decrease in Helmand’s cultivation levels despite the increased price of poppy in part to the efforts of the provincial governor, Gulab Mangal, who has been among the most active of Afghanistan’s leaders in trying to reduce poppy cultivation. They also credit an array of international programs that spent hundreds of millions of dollars on seed and fertilizer subsidies, irrigation canal cleaning and market reconstruction.
In the past few years, many markets had been closed or sharply constrained by insurgent activity. With more than 10,000 coalition troops in Helmand, though, the area has become somewhat more secure. It is still one of the most unstable and deadly parts of Afghanistan.
Governor Mangal eradicated about 10,000 acres of poppies, more than in any other province, and while eradication is widely viewed as useful only if it is paired with other support programs, in some areas of Helmand it has been. By contrast, in Kandahar, just under 160 acres were eradicated in 2010, and the governor, Wesa Torylai, has not pursued a comprehensive program to reduce poppy cultivation.
In Kandahar on Thursday, a suicide bomber attacked a NATO convoy, killing three Afghan civilians and wounding nine others on the main highway near the vast coalition base at the Kandahar airfield, according to Zalmai Ayoubi, a spokesman for Governor Torylai.  A coalition spokesman said there was no information yet on whether there were NATO casualties.
Five NATO service members were killed in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, according to a NATO spokesman who said that four of them  died when roadside bombs exploded. NATO also said that it inadvertently killed four Afghan civilians and injured three others in a strike in Ghazni Province on Wednesday.

Kim Jong-un, center, the youngest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, attended a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party in Pyongyang on Tuesday.
The photo was published in the Thursday issue of North Korea’s main newspaper, Rodong Shinmun, and showed him in a dark suit with his father and a large group of senior Workers’ Party officials. He bears a strong resemblance to his father and, some thought, his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder.
Video broadcast on television showed Kim Jong-un sitting in the front row of the Workers Party meeting this week, among a group of senior leaders.
This week, at a landmark meeting of the Workers’ Party in the capital, Pyongyang, the younger Mr. Kim, who is believed to be 27 or 28, was given the rank of four-star general in the People’s Army and was named a deputy chairman of the party’s military commission. He also became a member of the party’s Central Committee,  an ideological and policy-making post.
In the photograph, Kim Jong-un, chubby and looking somewhat older than his years, was seated two spots to his father’s right and next to another rising star, Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, seated between them.
Mr. Ri, 67, whose military rank as vice marshal places him over Kim Jong-un, was named to the country’s powerful Politburo this week and also was made a deputy chairman of the party’s military commission. The vice marshal, who has served as chief of the army general staff, is seen as a seasoned officer with substantial field experience. South Korean news media reports have suggested that he guided Kim Jong-un in his fast-track military training over the last year and he is expected to be Mr. Kim’s tutor and guide in political and military matters.
Analysts and diplomats in Washington will be watching for “the gradual insertion of the Young General into the policy and decision-making apparatus,” said Evans J. R. Revere, a longtime United States diplomat in South Korea and Asia who is diplomat in residence and lecturer at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. Young General is a title used by North Korean news media to refer to the younger Mr. Kim.
“There have been several reports that he had been given a lower-level position in the National Defense Commission some months back,” Mr. Revere said, “and I expect that there have been similar efforts to expose him to the government, military and party decision-making process over the past two years.”
The new North Korean appointments seemed not to have any immediate effect on North-South relations, which have been strained by the sinking in March of the South Korean warship Cheonan . While the two sides’ militaries met for the first time in two years on Thursday, the talks ended with no apparent progress and no new meetings scheduled, according to an official with South Korea’s Defense Ministry.
The talks began at 10 a.m. in the border village of Panmunjom and adjourned at 11:45 a.m., said the Defense Ministry official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. He declined to discuss the mood of the meeting.
He said South Korea demanded an apology for the Cheonan sinking, which Seoul has attributed to a North Korean torpedo attack. The sinking, which occurred along the two Koreas’ disputed western sea border, killed 46 South Korean sailors.
The North has denied any involvement in the Cheonan sinking and on Thursday proposed that South Korea accept a team of investigators from the North. The South refused the request, the defense official said.
A statement by the United Nations Security Council in July expressed “deep concern” over the Cheonan sinking, but did not find North Korea culpable. The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations told reporters at the time that the finding was “a great diplomatic victory.”
Lee Sung-yoon, a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University , said North Korea “has closed the chapter on the Cheonan,” citing the United Nations statement. “They’re saying, ‘Let’s move on,’¬†” he said.
The renewal of working-level military talks was proposed this month by the North Koreans, apparently to focus on preventing naval clashes along the disputed sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line. The North has also been angered by airborne leaflets sent across the border by South Korean activists. The leaflets, which criticize and ridicule Kim Jong-il, call on North Koreans to rise up against his government.
Political analysts in Seoul were reluctant to connect the sudden resumption of military negotiations to what appeared to be the emergence of Kim Jong-un as the eventual successor to his father.
The North’s official Korean Central News Agency also on Thursday released a new list of the rosters of various party organizations, along with the appointments made at the Workers’ Party meeting this week in Pyongyang.

BEIJING — After a night of wining and dining 50 of China’s richest people in the name of promoting philanthropy, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates told a horde of journalists on Thursday that the biggest difference between eating with Chinese tycoons and Western ones was the food.

Thus ended the two billionaires’ mission to promote charity in China, a journey that provoked weeks of breathless speculation here about whether this nation’s much resented class of superrich was too miserly to measure up to Western philanthropic standards.
At a news conference, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates said the answer was an emphatic “no.”
“I was amazed last night, really, at how similar the questions and discussions and all that was to the dinners we had in the U.S.,” said Mr. Buffett, who had wisecracked about the food. “The same motivations tend to exist. The mechanism for manifesting those motivations may differ from country to country.”
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, two of the best known and most admired Westerners here, announced last month that they planned to invite 50 wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs to dinner in Beijing to encourage philanthropy among China’s new rich. The mission became the subject of feverish news coverage — and something of a litmus test of Chinese generosity — after it was reported that some tycoons were turning down the invitation because they feared they would be pressed to donate money.
The two men have made headlines worldwide for enlisting Western tycoons in a public promise to give away their fortunes either during their lifetimes or in bequests after their deaths. To date, 40 people have taken the pledge, and at least one Chinese multimillionaire has said he will join them.
On Thursday, the two men pronounced the dinner an unqualified success, saying that two-thirds of those who were invited had shown up, and that more than half of them had offered their own ideas on how Chinese philanthropy should work.
The guest list was not made public, but the Chinese news media reported that it included Jet Li, the movie star; Niu Gensheng, the founder of a Chinese dairy business; and Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, who control the SOHO China real estate empire.
As with four earlier dinners held in the United States, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates said, no one at the Beijing event was asked to donate money or to promise to engage in charity. While they have made follow-up telephone calls to some previous guests, Mr. Buffett said: “Bill and I will not be calling anybody. What happens in China will depend on what the Chinese people feel about a project of this sort.”
China is widely reported to be second only to the United States in the number of dollar billionaires. Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett said the nation was unique in that its wealthy class had arisen almost wholly in the past 30 years, so philanthropic practices that are entrenched among European and American dynasties are new here, and open to change.
“What you have is a first generation of fortune,” Mr. Gates said, “and it’s natural that they’re thinking through, in this society in particular, ‘What do you do?’¬†”
The two said the dinner was not a long planned matter, but an offshoot of a trip that Mr. Buffett had already scheduled to Guangdong and Hunan Provinces, where BYD Company, a maker of clean-energy automobiles, has factories. Mr. Buffett’s investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, holds a 10 percent stake in the company.
“Bill and I did not sit down, take a map of the world, and say, ‘We’re going to go to that one and that one and that one,’¬†” Mr. Buffett said.
But Mr. Gates suggested that their philanthropic globetrotting was not yet over. “We may do an event in India,” he said.

BEIJING — Chinese authorities have released three of four Japanese citizens who were accused last week of videotaping at a military installation in northern China , state media reported on Thursday.
Although one of the detained men remains in custody, the releases are likely to be construed as a modest attempt by China to reduce tensions that have been mounting since Sept. 7, when a collision between a Chinese fishing trawler and Japanese coast guard vessels in disputed waters prompted an ugly diplomatic row between the countries.
In announcing the releases, the official news service, Xinhua, said the three men had admitted that they had violated Chinese law and “showed regret for their mistake.”
But it said that the fourth man, Sada Takahashi, would remain under “house arrest” while the authorities continued their investigation. Xinhua described the accusations against him as “illegally videotaping military targets.” The men, who were arrested on  Sept. 23, were detained at a military installation in Shijiazhuang, a city in Hebei Province, not far from Beijing.
The Japanese foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, called on China to free Mr. Takahashi and explain the reasons behind the detentions, which came on the same day that Japan , under immense pressure from China, released the  captain of the trawler, who was accused of deliberately ramming Japanese boats.
“I want to seek a quick resolution,” Mr. Maehara said, referring to the remaining detainee.
Yutaka Banno, the state secretary for foreign affairs, told reporters that a Japanese Embassy official had spoken by telephone with the three men who were freed and confirmed their safety.
“We will ask China to ensure the safety of the remaining one, our continued access to him and a quick settlement of the case from a humanitarian standpoint,” Mr. Banno said.
Officials at Fujita, the construction company that employed the men, said that at the time of their arrest they were inspecting a potential construction site for a plant that would process abandoned chemical weapons. Fujita built a similar plant in Nanjing that disposes of munitions abandoned by Japanese forces  during its occupation of China, the company said in a news release.
The release of the three men came  amid signs that the diplomatic standoff between Japan and China may be easing, although neither side has made any broad gestures of reconciliation.
The dispute between the countries stems from conflicting territorial claims over a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that Japan controls.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan reiterated Japan’s claim over the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.
“Territorial problems don’t exist between Japan and China,” he told Parliament.
Later in the day, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman urged Tokyo to stop making “irresponsible remarks.” “We are willing to resolve our disputes through friendly negotiations, but the Chinese government’s and people’s will and resolve are unswerving on issues involving China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Jiang Yu, the spokeswoman, said during a regular news conference.
In the meantime, Chinese shipments of rare earths to Japan have yet to resume, although some industry officials said the refusal of Chinese customs officials to process export applications had eased slightly since they were halted last week. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has denied that there is even an export ban on the minerals, which are crucial to Japanese manufacturers.
Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Tokyo.

Construction sites dot Beijing, a sign of China's robust economy. China's leaders will soon unveil a new Five-Year Plan.
The Chinese Communist Party’s annual plenum, a chance for top officials across the country to hash out strategy, will meet from Oct. 15 to 18, according to a government statement on Tuesday.
But already, the country’s political classes are chattering about what may or may not happen at this secretive gathering.
The only firm piece of business known to be on the agenda is the country’s Five-Year Plan, which could move China toward a less export-oriented economic model — with implications for issues like the United States trade deficit. It is also likely that officials will begin to determine the succession to the leadership duo of President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , both of whom are to retire in two years.
But it is the talk about political reform that makes this year’s meeting intriguing. Some officials have been calling for an overhaul of the country’s political system, saying it is dominated by powerful interest groups that are shutting out innovation and hurting the Chinese people. Others at the top have been silent or have explicitly rejected such talk.
“Some in the leadership are concerned with rising tensions due to inequality of wealth, the demolition of people’s homes, the petitioners — there is a sense that something needs to be done,” said Victor Shih, a professor of political science at Northwestern University .
“At the same time they know it’s a dangerous game; in the past when the party signaled some loosening, protests have coalesced that went beyond the ruling party’s control.”
To many, China hardly seems in need of a system overhaul. The country weathered the global financial crisis with robust economic growth, overtaking Japan this year as the world’s second largest economy. For several years, some foreign pundits have praised a “Beijing consensus” of market reforms and a strong central government that can make tough but unpopular decisions as a model for other developing countries.
But on the ground, the situation is far messier. Recent growth has been bolstered by a large stimulus package, not the bold changes that characterized China’s economic takeoff in the 1980s and ’90s. The last serious reform push took place early last decade when the country was joining the World Trade Organization . Since then, the pendulum has swung back to strong state involvement , with quasi-monopolistic state enterprises crowding out private enterprise.
Liberal economists in Beijing have been warning about the long-term dangers of this trend. One of the chief economic thinkers, Yao Yang, a Peking University professor, published an article earlier this year that encapsulated their views. Writing in the journal Foreign Affairs , he argued that in decades past the Communist Party took relatively unbiased positions on economic matters, allowing it to defy vested interests and choose pro-growth policies.
Now, the party has become closely intertwined with China’s biggest businesses — which are mostly state owned and directly managed by the party. At the same time, it remains atop a one-party state with few checks and balances, giving those businesses insurmountable advantages over private enterprises and citizens. Critics say that that power structure worsens China’s inequality and cannot be easily rectified without systematic changes. Professor Yao’s concluded that “ultimately there is no alternative to greater democratization.”
In August, speaking in Shenzhen, the Chinese city that pioneered many economic changes, Prime Minister Wen echoed these arguments in a speech carried by the party’s flagship daily, People’s Daily .
“Without the guarantee of political system reform, the successes of restructuring the economic system will be lost and the goal of modernization cannot be realized,” Mr. Wen said, according to the article on his speech.
When Chinese leaders talk about political reform they often mean making the administrative system more efficient or open, but not democratic in a Western sense. Some analysts, like Russell Leigh Moses, who is based in Beijing, think Mr. Wen’s speech was meant to be an attempt to advocate more sweeping changes.
“There are forces within the government that believe administrative reform has run its course,” Mr. Moses said. “And now it’s time to get into the nub of the challenge facing China, which is, what sort of polity do you want?”
What does seem clear is that Mr. Wen’s call has exposed differing priorities among senior leaders. Also speaking in Shenzhen, which was celebrating the 30th anniversary of its creation as a Special Economic Zone, President Hu did not mention political reform. More pointedly, the country’s head of security, Zhou Yongkang, rejected political reform. In an article carried in the party’s main theoretical journal, Qiushi , Mr. Zhou wrote that some party members had been influenced by “erroneous Western political and legal ideas.”
Mr. Wen, however, reiterated his support for political reform last week, albeit in a less influential setting. Speaking to Chinese-American business people in New York, Mr. Wen said political reform would lead to “a relaxed political environment, so people can better express their independent spirit and creativity.”
The link between these arguments and this year’s economic plan is that few observers can see substantive economic changes taking place without curbing the party’s power.
“Wen’s speech is part of a discussion on the structure of growth,” said Arthur Kroeber, the managing director of the Beijing-based economic research group Dragonomics. “China needs a little less of growth at all costs.”
That could be reflected in the main topic of discussion at the plenum, the country’s Five-Year Plan. In years past, the plan has set firm targets for economic growth, usually 8 percent, which Mr. Kroeber said was a signal to local leaders that all that mattered was growth — regardless of the social or political costs. This led to large-scale land expropriations in Chinese cities, rampant pollution and a preference for state monopolies.  Now, he said, the hope among many economists in Beijing is that the party will back off its growth target, signaling that it will accept slower growth in exchange for real changes.
During the plenum, the country’s future leader, Xi Jinping, is likely to be appointed to the Central Military Commission. A position overseeing military affairs is the last major appointment Mr. Xi needs to round out his r√©sum√© and cement his position as heir to President Hu, who currently leads the military commission.
Last year, Mr. Xi was also expected to have been appointed to the slot, but he was not. Political analysts are unsure of how to interpret this, but the consensus among China watchers is that Mr. Xi’s position is secure, and he is likely to receive the military post soon.

153;"Chinese Developers Tap Into Japanese Insecurity
Hiro Komae for The New York Times
A community hot spring in Misasa, a resort town in Japan. Chinese investors are planning to build vacation homes nearby.
MISASA, Japan — A plan by Chinese real estate developers to invest in this little mountain town has opened a window onto a Japanese crisis of confidence.
Add to Portfolio
Hiro Komae for The New York Times
Kiyomi Kawakami, left, is working with Chinese partners to build 47 luxury homes in Misasa.
For locals here, the planned development — vacation homes for rich Chinese — is a welcome infusion of capital into a town that has been in decline since its heyday in the 1980s as a hot spring resort.
But seen from elsewhere in Japan — there have been news accounts in the national media, not all of them accurate — the investment is a menace to the area’s pristine forests and streams, a land grab that threatens the country’s natural resources and a chilling reminder of the expanding shadow cast by China , which recently surpassed Japan to become the world’s second-largest economy after the United States.
“Targeted by Foreign Money? Japan’s Forests for Sale,” was the warning title of a news program this month by the public broadcaster, NHK.
A fear that “China money” is buying up the Japanese homeland is spreading across this nation, fanned by news reports and a general anxiety over Tokyo’s fading economic prowess and an increasingly hostile wealthy neighbor. The amount of money invested is still small by China’s standards, but seems to be setting off an outsize reaction among the Japanese.
Tokyo’s recent retreat from the diplomatic face-off over the arrest of a Chinese trawler captain , and China’s suspension of shipments of vital industrial metals and minerals to Japan,  have also put many Japanese on edge.
“I’m all for closer ties with China, but we need to be on our guard,” said Hideki Hirano , author of the book “Japan’s Forests Under Siege: How Foreign Capital Threatens Our Water Source,” which was published in March. “We need to be more vigilant about who’s buying what.”
Here in Misasa, however, nationalist rhetoric is often tempered by pragmatism.
“Rich Chinese spend money in ways that no longer exist in Japan,” said Kiyomi Kawakami, a local developer who plans to build 47 luxury homes in Misasa with partners from Shanghai.
“People warn me not to sell land to the Chinese,” he said. “But I run a business. If somebody’s buying, I’m selling.”
Whether in far-flung corners of Japan like Misasa or in corporate boardrooms, there is a realization that as the Chinese economy booms, Japan needs — even as it remains wary of — China’s money.
The sentiment is reminiscent of the way Americans feared Japanese economic imperialism in the 1980s, alarmed by the acquisition of United States icons like Rockefeller Center by Mitsubishi and Columbia Pictures by Sony .
Chinese companies spent $120 million in the first half of this year to acquire various small and midsize Japanese enterprises, taking advantage of depressed asset prices, according to a recent report from Goldman Sachs . The figure represents a sixfold increase from the comparable period last year. China is also now Japan’s biggest trading partner, with overall trade surging by a third, to 12.6 trillion yen ($151 billion) in the first half of the year, compared with the same period last year.
“We shouldn’t think it a bad thing that foreign investors are recognizing value in Japan,” said Kazuhiko Masumoto, an analyst at the Mitsubishi Research Institute in Tokyo.
But Japan’s finance ministry has seemed slow to agree.
This month, Japan’s finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, asked Chinese policy makers to “clarify their objectives” after recent bulk purchases of Japanese government bonds. Tokyo was concerned that the buying was helping to drive up the yen’s value — making Japan’s exports less competitive with China’s.
Bowing to economic realities, and Japan’s already high levels of public debt, Finance Ministry officials have since then played down the conflict, saying Japan was happy to find foreign takers of its government bonds.
Until the trawler dispute prompted some tour groups to at least temporarily cancel trips to Japan, waves of newly rich Chinese tourists, with pocketbooks open, had been welcomed in Japan — even while heightening a sense that the country is at the mercy of rich Chinese.
Reports of Chinese snapping up Japan’s mountains and forests have struck a raw nerve, however. Although Japan is known for its big cities, about 70 percent of its landmass is mountainous forest, and the purchases raise the specter of China’s gaining control of the cherished hinterlands.
Japan’s logging industry is in decline, as the country has been flooded with cheap imported timber. As a result, forest real estate now sells for rock-bottom prices, and many plots have been abandoned by absentee or aged owners and have fallen into a state of neglect.
In January, the Tokyo Foundation , a respected independent research organization where Mr. Hirano, the author, is an analyst, issued a widely read report warning that foreign brokers could extract natural resources like timber and water and threaten Japan’s national security.
“If we wait until the exploitation of Japan’s natural resources by global interests is well under way,” the report said, “it may be too late.”

A Balinese volunteer prepares to give rabies vaccination to a dog in Pararean, Bali.
But since the first recorded human death from rabies in Bali in late 2008, that nuisance has become a mounting public danger as the virus — believed to have arrived with an infected dog from another part of the Indonesian archipelago — has spread with increasing speed. Forty-one rabies deaths have been confirmed, and dozens more are suspected.
No foreigners have died from the disease, but the outbreak is causing concern abroad, and countries including the United States and Australia have issued travel warnings this year because of it.
This week, the Balinese authorities and a nonprofit group, the Bali Animal Welfare Association, began a mass dog vaccination campaign, funded largely with foreign assistance. Moving from village to village, the teams’ goal is to vaccinate 400,000 animals, roughly 70 percent of the island’s dog population, by the end of the year. Rabies is present in dogs in more than 200 of Bali’s 700 or so villages, said Putu Sumantra, the head of the provincial animal husbandry department.
Officials hope that the campaign, along with follow-up rounds in the next two years, will curb the disease by 2012. Still, experts and officials acknowledge that an earlier, failed approach; funding shortfalls; bureaucratic inflexibility; and Bali’s own culture delayed concerted action.
The death of Made Cawi, a 70-year-old grandmother from Mambal, a rice-farming village, illustrates the problem. Coming home one day in July, she complained of a stiff jaw, a fever and difficulty swallowing. By the next day she had been hospitalized, and within three days she was dead, said her son, Nyoman Kasna.
“She was always getting fevers,” Mr. Kasna said. “I thought it was just something mild. I didn’t think it would turn out like this.”
Like many Balinese, Ms. Cawi lived cheek by jowl with pigs, ducks, chickens and dogs, which freely wander the island’s streets. Dog bites have long been a fact of life on Bali, regarded as little more than an inconvenience.
But earlier in the year, after Ms. Cawi was bitten by a dog, her son took her to a hospital for post-exposure treatment. She was administered just two doses of a three-injection vaccine course and sent home early with assurances that she was healthy, her son said.
Months later, rabies killed her. Dr. Dwi Tresnaningsih, head of disease surveillance at the local community health center, said it was common practice to end post-exposure treatment if the animal suspected of causing the infection did not die within two weeks. She said it was likely that Ms. Cawi was later bitten by a different animal but did not report it.
One obstacle to controlling the rabies problem has been that Bali’s majority Hindu population is extremely fond of dogs, unlike Indonesians from other parts of the country, whose adherence to Islam means that many see dogs as unclean animals. On Bali, an island with a population of 3.5 million people, there are about 600,000 dogs.
“We’re very close to dogs because in our religion, dogs accompany people to heaven,” said Mr. Sumantra, the animal husbandry department chief.
Balinese tend to mingle freely with stray dogs, and even most dogs that have owners are allowed to run between homes and streets as semi-strays.
The island’s first attempt to combat the outbreak was an unsuccessful culling campaign in which 100,000 dogs were killed. Particularly in the early days of the outbreak, Balinese were loath to hand over dogs for culling, said Nyoman Sutedja, the head of Bali’s health department. Workers were faced with angry locals; in one case, in the tourist region of Sanur, a government worker was attacked, Mr. Sutedja said.
With Bali having long been rabies-free, and with dog bites such a common part of life, most people were unaware of the dangers, Mr. Sutedja said. “People in the villages just think, ‘No one has ever died from dog bites, so why is there rabies now?”’
Local sensitivities aside, culling was bound to have failed, said Fran√ßois-Xavier Meslin, leader of the World Health Organization ’s Neglected Zoonotic Diseases team in Geneva.

SEOUL, South Korea — Just a day after a new leadership structure had taken shape  in North Korea , with the youngest son of the nation’s leader being awarded major military and political posts, the South Korean Defense Ministry said that the two Koreas held military talks on Thursday at the border village of Panmunjom.

North Korea on Wednesday released a photo taken Tuesday of leader Kim Jong-Il, center, sitting in front of a statue of his father, Kim Il-Sung, as he attended the Conference of the Workers’ Party of Korea in Pyongyang.
The two sides had not held such talks in two years.
A South Korean defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the agenda of the working-level meeting. But it was widely expected that South Korea would raise the issue of the sinking of one of its warships in March.
The renewal of military talks with the South was proposed this month by the North Koreans , apparently to focus on preventing naval clashes along their disputed western sea border.
Political analysts in Seoul were reluctant to connect the sudden resumption of military negotiations to what appeared to be the emergence of the son, Kim Jong-un, as the eventual successor to his father, Kim Jong-il , as the supreme North Korean leader. The younger Mr. Kim, who is believed to be 27 or 28, was given the rank of four-star general in the People’s Army and was named a deputy chairman of the military commission of the Workers’ Party.
A senior military post for Kim Jong-un was a prerequisite for his ascendancy to power. His father’s “military first” doctrine  has given the armed forces the leading role in the political life of the country, even ahead of the Workers’ Party. Any future leader of North Korea would need a substantial military paragraph on his or her r√©sum√©.
Kim Jong-un’s other significant new positions — he now has a seat on the party’s Central Committee and is one of two deputy chairmen of the party’s military commission — are seen as more purely political and policy-making posts. The military commission’s other new deputy chairman is Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho. A seasoned military officer,  Marshal Ri, 68, has been chief of the army’s general staff. He was also given a seat on the party’s Politburo, making him a superior of the younger Mr. Kim, whom he is expected to tutor and guide.
“Ri should be seen as the right-hand man for the inexperienced Kim Jong-un in the military,” Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at Sejong Institute near Seoul, told the Yonhap News Agency.  He will “play a crucial role in the transfer of power from Kim Jong-il to Kim Jong-un,” Mr. Cheong said.
But other analysts said the changes were not likely to be well received by North Koreans who see the dynastic succession as a contradiction of the state’s Communist ideology.
“This kind of succession is very rare, and the ordinary North Korean people won’t like it,” said Yun Duk-kim, a North Korea expert and a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. But, he added: “It’s difficult for people to show their displeasure, of course. It’s a totalitarian system. They just obey.”
The North was also thought to have objected to propaganda leaflets that were dropped over the border by South Korean activists. The leaflets talked about Kim Jong-il’s frailty and his lavish lifestyle in the face of widespread hunger. They called on North Koreans to rise up against the regime.
South Korea and the United States have blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking of its ship, the Cheonan , which killed 46 sailors. Seoul has demanded an apology from the North, which has denied any involvement.
A statement by the United Nations Security Council in July expressed “deep concern” over the Cheonan’s sinking, but did not find North Korea culpable. The North Korean ambassador told reporters that the statement was “a great diplomatic victory.”
Lee Sung-yoon, a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University , said Wednesday that North Korea “has closed the chapter on the Cheonan” since the United Nations statement. “They’re saying, ‘Let’s move on,’¬†” he said.
Analysts in Seoul said that North Korea was unlikely to apologize — at least not officially or publicly. But others did not rule it out.

A senior Chinese education official says that China plans to have 150,000 foreign students studying for degrees by 2020, according to a report on Wednesday in China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. The central government intends to offer more scholarships and to encourage local governments and schools to do the same, the report said. The plan to attract more foreigners to degree programs is part of the country’s push to increase its soft power, or influence through culture and diplomacy. The official, Hao Ping, vice minister of education, said that the 240,000 foreign students in China last year were a record. About 60 percent of foreign students are studying Chinese, and 13.5 percent are studying medicine.

157;"Divided Parliament Opens in Australia
By MERAIAH FOLEY
Reprints
SYDNEY, Australia — Australia ’s most bitterly divided Parliament in recent history convened for the first time on Tuesday as Prime Minister Julia Gillard urged legislators  to engage in “consensus, not confrontation.”
Ms. Gillard, whose hold on power hinges on the continued support of three independent lawmakers and a legislator from the left-leaning Greens Party, is facing  a conservative opposition that has pledged to topple her before her three-year term is over.
Leading Australia’s first minority government in 70 years, she  has vowed to press ahead with an ambitious agenda, including plans to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions and impose a 30-percent tax on the profits from mining coal and iron ore, Australia’s two main exports. These battles are not expected until next year, at the earliest, but Ms. Gillard has said that the government will introduce at least 30 other bills to Parliament this week.
Tony Abbott, the leader of the conservative Liberal Party, has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of Ms. Gillard’s government after the inconclusive national election on Aug. 21 failed to deliver a clear victory to either side. Ms. Gillard’s supporters have accused him of trying to destabilize the government and force an early election.
“This term of Parliament is not an opportunity to refight the election, vote after vote, bill after bill,” Ms. Gillard said  at a ceremonial opening of Australia’s 43rd Parliament in the capital, Canberra. “This is a time for consensus, not confrontation; debate, not destruction.”
Ms. Gillard scored her first parliamentary victory on Tuesday when her nominee for speaker of the 150-member House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins, was elected unopposed. Under Australian conventions, the speaker is not allowed to cast a vote except in the event of a tie, effectively giving Ms. Gillard a one-vote majority in the lower house.
With such a razor-thin advantage, Ms. Gillard cannot afford to have a single member of Parliament, including herself, absent for any major vote.
Moreover, Mr. Abbott has threatened to restrict the traditional practice of “pairing,” in which the opposition party agrees to remove one of its lawmakers from the floor when the prime minister or a senior minister is absent from a parliamentary vote.
The opposition leader has said he will only grant pairings in some medical cases or when the government lawmaker is engaged in business vital to the national interest, a position that could severely hamper the ability of the prime minister and other senior legislators  to travel while  Parliament is  sitting.
“This is an opposition that will hold this government to account,” Mr. Abbott said on Tuesday. “This will be a Parliament of robust debate.”
Under such rancorous conditions, many analysts believe that the success of Ms. Gillard’s minority government will depend on her ability to keep the independents and the Greens happy. However, having joined  with Labor, the four nonparty members of Ms. Gillard’s minority government now have a vested interest in ensuring the government’s success.
“I would be surprised if the government did not last its full term,” said Geoff Robinson, an expert in Australian politics at Deakin University in Victoria State. “In terms of keeping the Greens and the independents on side, that is going to require some work.”
The four coalition members have not given their unqualified support to Labor. While they have agreed to support the government’s annual budgets and oppose  no-confidence motions from the opposition, they have retained the right to judge each Labor policy on its merits.
Ms. Gillard has already given a number of concessions to her coalition partners. She has appointed a new cabinet-level minister for rural affairs, in response to concerns raised by two of the independents, who represent country areas, and has reversed her previous opposition to the idea of a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“Clearly, we are in a very different environment than we were during the election campaign,” Ms. Gillard said  on Monday at the announcement of a new parliamentary committee to assess the best way of putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. “If you’re going to have this work, then you’ve got to have options on the table.”

TOKYO — Kim Jong-il , North Korea ’s supreme leader, took new steps on Tuesday to ensure that his family remains in charge after his death, but the biggest leadership shuffling in a generation has so far produced more political intrigue than signs of real change in North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated nations.
Mr. Kim elevated his sister and a close friend to a high military ranking and had his youngest son and heir apparent, Kim Jong-un , made a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party.
The promotions came a day after the younger Mr. Kim was also made a four-star general and seemed aimed at ensuring a dynastic succession that would give Mr. Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, time to solidify his power.
The elevation of the completely unknown Mr. Kim, and hints that other members of the extended Kim clan will exercise power behind the scenes in a kind of Communist regency, add to the uncertainty about North Korea. It appears to have mostly abandoned its incipient economic reforms and has declined to enter new international talks about its nuclear weapons program, leaving its neighbors and the United States alarmed about its intentions.
Few analysts claim to fully understand the inner workings of the North Korean military or the Kim dynasty. But many who watch the country closely say they see few signs that succession will produce a stable, credible leadership that is, at least initially, confident enough to engage with the outside world or to steer resources to economic development rather than the military.
“We worry about Pakistan, but this is potentially every bit as destabilizing as Pakistan,” said William R. Keylor, a professor of international relations at Boston University . “Succession in North Korea would just be an oddity if it were not for the fact that we are dealing with a country with nuclear weapons and delivery systems. That is what makes this serious.”
Fear of instability also followed the death of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder, and the rise of his son, Kim Jong-il, in 1994. The country did not collapse then, though its economic performance deteriorated sharply and millions of North Koreans are thought to have starved to death during Kim Jong-il’s erratic tenure.
This time, the country appears less well prepared for a transition. Kim Jong-il had 14 years between his political introduction in 1980 and his father’s death, time he used to build support internally. There are few signs that a succession process had even begun when Kim Jong-il,  68, apparently suffered a stroke two years ago.
Some analysts predict that new leaders may feel compelled to prove their nationalist credentials by engaging in provocative actions that could worsen tensions with South Korea and Japan and their main ally, the United States. In March, South Korea accused the North of sinking one of its warships, the Cheonan , which some analysts say appears to have been a display of force meant to persuade the military to respect the younger Mr. Kim.
“The question now is whether they will do dangerous things like the Cheonan or something else to hold the regime together,” said Victor Cha, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University . “They were already unstable as it was, and this succession issue makes them even more unpredictable.”
In the most destabilizing situation, an internal power struggle could also lead to the collapse of the government. But many observers discount that possibility, largely because of the support of another neighbor, China.
Beijing has made it clear that it is determined to avoid a political eruption on its borders. It has consistently taken steps to aid North Korea when the North has had severe shortages of food and energy, and it has tried to ensure that international sanctions intended to punish the North for its development of nuclear weapons are not crippling.
Kim Jong-il has made two visits to China in recent months to shore up its support. China has said that the younger Mr. Kim was not a member of his father’s delegation in China a month ago, but American officials say they believe the son indeed was on the trip and may have met Chinese officials informally.
“What China is most concerned about is stability, namely stability in North Korea, the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” said Xu Wenji, an expert on North Korea at the Northeast Asia Institute at Jilin University. “So the concern for stability overrides everything else on this matter for the Chinese government.”
The reasons behind the elevation of Kim Jong-il’s sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and Choe Ryong-hae, a lifelong friend of the Korean leader and a member of his inner circle, along with the promotion of Kim Jong-un, are uncertain.
Experts suggested that the three, along with the sister’s husband, Jang Song-taek, might end up forming a new ruling group that could have the power to keep the military in check and continue the  dynasty, at least until the son can fully replace his father.
The promotion of the sister caught some analysts by surprise. Mr. Cha at Georgetown said it represented public recognition for someone who was already the power behind the throne in the Kim dynasty. He said that she was the confidante and the woman closest to Kim Jong-il, whose wives and mother are dead, and that she even took care of the leader when he was ill.

BEIJING — After weeks of escalating diplomatic tension over Japan ’s detention of a Chinese fishing captain, China on Tuesday called on Tokyo to cooperate in resolving the messy dispute involving territorial sovereignty, compensation for damaged boats and such intangibles as wounded national pride.

Block on Minerals Called Threat to Japan’s Economy (September 29, 2010)
“China highly values China-Japan relations,” Jiang Yu, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said during a regular news conference. “But safeguarding bilateral relations requires that the two sides meet halfway and requires Japan to take candid and practical actions.”
The comments were less strident than previous admonishments and threats by Chinese officials, including a warning of “full consequences” by the normally taciturn premier, Wen Jiabao , should Japan fail to acquiesce to their demands.
The latest comments came hours after the Japanese foreign minister insisted that there was nothing to discuss regarding sovereignty over the string of islands in the East China Sea that both sides claim.
“No territorial issue exists,” the foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, told Parliament, the Kyodo News Agency reported  Tuesday.
China has made its displeasure known beyond its verbal sparring by halting top-level political contacts, canceling tour groups, and stopping the shipment of minerals crucial to Japanese automakers and other manufacturers, although the Chinese commerce minister has denied the existence of an export ban.
The imbroglio has been raging since Sept. 8, when Japanese sailors arrested the captain of a Chinese trawler during a confrontation that may or may not have involved the captain intentionally ramming his ship into two Japanese Coast Guard patrol vessels. Known as the Diaoyu to the Chinese and Senkaku to the Japanese, the uninhabited islets northeast of Taiwan are claimed by both countries and Taiwan but are administered by Japan.
After angry protests by the Chinese government — and a modest rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing — prosecutors released the captain on Friday, a move that was widely interpreted as a diplomatic victory for China and an affirmation of its growing economic might.
But the release, apparently, was not enough to soothe China’s fury. Hours later, Beijing demanded an apology and compensation for the fisherman’s damaged ship as the state-run media celebrated the return of the captain, Zhan Qixiong . (After savoring an official celebration with fireworks and pounding drums, Mr. Zhan, 41, promptly vowed to return to the disputed waters.)
Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan, feeling the heat for his perceived bow to a longtime rival, has since rejected Chinese demands for money and an apology. For good measure, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary is asking China to pay for repairs to the damaged coast guard vessels.
“Naturally, we will be asking for the boats to be returned to their original condition,” he said earlier in the week.
It has not helped the diplomatic efforts that China continues to hold four Japanese citizens who were arrested last Friday after being accused of videotaping at a military installation not far from Beijing.
On Tuesday, Japan’s economics minister warned that the ban on rare-earth mineral exports could pose a significant threat to the Japanese economy.
“We need to restore Japan-China ties, especially economic exchanges, as soon as possible,” Banri Kaieda, the minister of economic and fiscal policy, said at a news conference, The Associated Press reported.
Wei Zhijiang, an expert on Sino-Japanese relations at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, said that while the Foreign Ministry’s latest comments could be viewed as an olive branch, he doubted that the Chinese side would be able to say much more,  given how emotional the issue is in China — where anti-Japanese sentiment is always just beneath the surface — and the approach of the holiday on Friday  commemorating the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, right, shakes hands with Pakistani Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
The military, preoccupied by a war against militants and reluctant to assume direct responsibility for the economic crisis, has made clear it is not eager to take over the government, as it has many times before, military officials and politicians said.
But the government’s performance since the floods, which have left 20 million people homeless and the nation dependent on handouts from skeptical foreign donors, has laid bare the deep underlying tensions between military and civilian leaders.
American officials, too, say it has left them increasingly disillusioned with Mr. Zardari, a deeply unpopular president who was elected two and a half years ago on a wave of sympathy after the assassination of his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
In a meeting on Monday that was played on the front page of Pakistan ’s newspapers, the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , confronted the president and his prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani , over incompetence and corruption in the government.
According to the press and Pakistani officials familiar with the conversation, the general demanded that they dismiss at least some ministers in the oversized 60-member cabinet, many of whom face corruption charges.
The civilian government has so far resisted the general’s demand. But the meeting was widely interpreted by the Pakistani news media, which has grown increasingly hostile to the president, as a rebuke to the civilian politicians and as having pushed the government to the brink.
After the meeting, the president’s office issued a statement, approved by all the men, saying they had agreed “to protect the democratic process and to resolve all issues in accordance with the constitution.”
A Pakistani official close to the president who was familiar with the conversation but did not want to be identified, said, “The president made it clear that he would not leave, come what may.”
“Sanity had prevailed,” the official added.
Since the floods, the government has defended its handling of the crisis, arguing that any government would have been overwhelmed by its scale.
Still, it is clear that General Kayani, head of the country’s most powerful institution, and the one that has taken the lead in the flood crisis, has ratcheted up the pressure on the government.
Having secured an exceptional three-year extension in his post from Mr. Zardari in July, General Kayani appears determined to prevent the economy from bankruptcy. Military officers in the main cities have been talking openly and expansively about their contempt for the Zardari government and what they term the economic calamity, an unusual candor, reporters and politicians said.
“The gross economic mismanagement by the government is at the heart of it,” said Rifaat Hussain, a professor of international relations at Islamabad University and a confidant of the military. “And there is the rising public disaffection with the Pakistani Peoples Party under Zardari and Gilani.”
As the military demands the overhaul, the Supreme Court is also pushing the government on the issue of corruption by threatening to remove the president’s immunity from prosecution, a move that would expose him to charges of corruption in an old money-laundering case in Switzerland.
The government has defied the court’s demand to write a letter to the Swiss government requesting a reopening of the case against Mr. Zardari, who  served 11 years in prison in Pakistan on unproved corruption charges. On Monday, the court granted an extension of two weeks for the government to reconsider its position.
Much of the rising disdain for the government has to do with the perception among the media and the public of the callous and inept handling of the floods by the nation’s wealthy ruling class.
Mr. Gilani drew public ire for appearing at an ersatz camp for flood victims set up just for television cameras. It also did not help that newspapers reported that scores of cartons from the London luxury store Harrods had arrived at his residence in Lahore at the height of the flooding.
Mr. Zardari, meanwhile, was vilified for visiting his chateau in France as torrents of water wiped out millions of villagers in his home province,  Sindh.
In his most recent visit to Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke , the American special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the international community could not be expected to provide all the billions of dollars needed to repair the flood damage, a warning interpreted here as a rebuke of the civilian government and its mismanagement.
But Washington, not unlike Pakistan’s military, is caught, American officials say, because there is no appetite for a return of military rule. Nor is there desire to see the opposition politician and former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif , resume power.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Repeating his determination to find a peaceful solution to the war, President Hamid Karzai named a 70-member peace council on Tuesday, a long-awaited announcement that was the government’s first concrete step to open formal contacts with the Taliban .

President Hamid Karzai is seen through the screen of a video camera as he cries while delivering a speech about the peace process.
The American commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David H. Petraeus , indicated support for the reconciliation process on Monday and said high-level members of the Taliban had already reached out to the government.
But some immediately dismissed Mr. Karzai’s council as unworkable, given that its membership was dominated largely by anti-Taliban figures.
While a handful of influential people from the former Taliban government have been included, the council is heavily weighted with many of the same factional leaders who have dominated the wars and politics of the past 30 years, and who have been fighting the Taliban for half that time.
Mr. Karzai also named at least eight women. Their appointment signaled the government’s intention to preserve the women’s rights guaranteed in the Constitution, but they are unlikely to have any influence with the Taliban.
The government defended the nominations, saying the council needed a broad range of powerful people. The council will have the authority to develop existing contacts and open direct negotiations with the Taliban and other armed foes, said the presidential spokesman, Waheed Omer.
“They will keep the president in the picture — it is his initiative — but they are very powerful people and will proceed as they see fit,” Mr. Omer said. The council will choose its own leader and way of operating. “The structure is such that in many ways they will have the authority and mandate to act,” he said.
Mr. Karzai has been calling for talks with the Taliban for months, and has gradually won the support of the United States and NATO for his plan. People close to the president say he has largely lost confidence in the ability of coalition forces to defeat the insurgency and is tentatively seeking his own course.
The extent of his concern about the failing war effort was displayed on national television on Tuesday when he burst into convulsive sobs during a speech to mark national literacy day at a Kabul high school.
He said he feared that the war would force his 3-year-old son, Mirwais, to leave the country and grow up a refugee. “I want him to go to school here,” Mr. Karzai said. “I swear to God I’m worried, I’m worried, oh people, I’m worried. God forbid Mirwais should be forced to leave Afghanistan,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse.
Supporters of peace talks welcomed the formation of the council as a first step and said it could work despite the preponderance of people opposed to the Taliban.
“These are faces from the jihad, the resistance, and from the Taliban, and they will have to resolve it,” said Hajji Abdul Baqi Raghbat, leader of the tribal affairs department in Kandahar Province, homeland of the Taliban. “These are the most famous people, and if not them, I don’t know who else there is.”
“The most important thing is that there is willingness and freedom from both sides to move towards peace talks,” Hajji Raghbat said. “The Taliban are outside the country, and they have to show their willingness,” he said, a reference to the Taliban leadership who are widely believed to live in Pakistan.
The council members would not do the actual negotiation, but would appoint smaller commissions of neutral mediators to approach the Taliban and bring back their answers, according to a lawmaker, Hajji Musa Khan Hotak, who has long supported talks with the Taliban.
Government officials say there has been an increase in contacts with Taliban members and signals from them since the government held a peace gathering in Kabul in June. A Western diplomat confirmed that some people had approached the government claiming to represent Taliban leaders, but said that it was not yet clear if they were genuine.
Former members of the Taliban government, including Maulavi Arsala Rahmani, who was the Taliban minister of higher education and is now a senator, say that Taliban leaders know that they cannot win the war and that the time is ripe for negotiation. “No one will win this war,” Mr. Rahmani said. “When the Taliban were in power they still could not control the whole country, and they know that.”
Yet others close to members of the Taliban leadership council say their stance remains resolutely opposed to negotiations while they are increasingly confident that the foreign troops will tire and leave in the coming years, handing them a victory.
Some also question whether Mr. Karzai and the people around him are really prepared to make the necessary concessions to make peace with the Taliban. Ministers interviewed in recent months supported the peace process publicly but privately said the Taliban had to be defeated.
Referring to Mr. Karzai, Martine van Bijlert, a director of the independent Afghan Analysts Network, said: “He is not interested in substantial talks. His position towards the Taliban is, ‘You can join me, you can surrender to our side.’ This means there is little appetite to listen to and address some of the real grievances. At the same time there is a real danger that the process will just be a gathering of yet more commanders.”
In Ghazni, a province south of Kabul, the deputy governor, Khazim Allayar, was killed by a suicide car bomber on Tuesday, along with four others, the Interior Ministry said.

162;"Test of India Verdict Will Lie in Public Reaction
Rajesh Kumar Singh/Associated Press
Pillars have been made for a Hindu temple dedicated to Ram in Ayodhya, India, where Hindu extremists destroyed a 16th-century mosque in 1992.
Reprints
NEW DELHI — The case has existed almost as long as independent India itself. Dating from 1950, the legal battle between Hindus and Muslims over a religious site in the city of Ayodhya began as a little-noticed title dispute. With a ruling finally expected on Thursday, the case has become something altogether different: a test of India’s secular soul.

A police officer patrolled last week outside a temple in Ayodhya. Thousands of security officers have been deployed to the city.
The test is not so much in the verdict, which will deal with a handful of issues, including the central question of which side controls the site of a 16th-century mosque known as the Babri Masjid. Rather, the test will come in the public reaction. In 1992, an enraged mob of Hindu extremists destroyed the mosque, asserting that the site was the birthplace of the Hindu deity, Ram. Riots erupted , claiming about 2,000 lives, mostly Muslims, and horrifying a nation founded on the ideal of religious tolerance.
For the past month, the Indian government and leaders of major political parties, including right-wing Hindu leaders who stoked the 1992 violence, have asked people to remain calm and refrain from violence. Thousands of security officers have been deployed to Ayodhya, though the authorities concede that riots could occur anywhere. The verdict is considered so politically combustible that an emergency appeal to delay the verdict until after the Commonwealth Games in October was sent to India’s Supreme Court last week — and rejected on Tuesday.
Later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called on the nation to “maintain peace, harmony and tranquillity.” Perhaps the only person eager for the verdict is Hashim Ansari, a Muslim tailor in Ayodhya who is the case’s oldest surviving plaintiff. He is 90 and tired of waiting. Mr. Ansari, who joined the case as a plaintiff in 1961, said in a telephone interview that he did not want any tumult or violence, just closure.
“It has taken on a political color,” Mr. Ansari said of the case. “We are just waiting for a verdict. Whatever judgment comes, all of us Muslims will agree, whether it is in our favor or not.”
The verdict could determine whether the mosque is rebuilt on the site or if a Hindu temple is erected there instead. Yet despite the official concern, many analysts believe that India has matured since the violence in 1992. Hindu nationalism, a potent political force in the 1990s that fueled the campaign to tear down the Babri Masjid, is now far less potent. Last year, when the government released the findings of a long-awaited investigation into the violence , the public response was largely a shrug.
“Urban India is not so closely tied with the Hindu nationalists today,” said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University who has written extensively about Hindu-Muslim relations in India.
Ayodhya is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh. India’s first Mughal ruler, Babur, constructed a domed mosque on the contested property, which became famous for its acoustics and for a drinking well whose waters were said to have curative powers. Uttar Pradesh is also considered the birthplace of Hinduism, and many Hindus believe that a temple originally existed on the site to commemorate the birthplace of Ram. Some historical accounts suggest that for many years Hindus and Muslims both worshiped inside the mosque complex.
But when the British took control of India, they eventually erected a barrier to divide religious worship at the site. Muslims were allowed inside to pray; Hindus worshiped on platforms outside the enclosure. There were periodic squabbles, but this arrangement remained intact until after India’s independence in 1947. In December 1949, someone slipped in the mosque and left idols of Ram and another Hindu deity.
The authorities closed the building and the matter soon went to court. A local Hindu filed for title in 1950. Mr. Ansari was a regular in the courtroom, monitoring proceedings, and his name was later included among the plaintiffs when a Muslim group filed its own lawsuit in 1961. In all, there are four title suits to be decided.
“What is at stake here is whether the Hindus have any right to this particular place,” said Prashant Bhushan, a prominent legal advocate in India. “They are going to decide whether there was a temple there before the mosque, and whether it gives them any rights.”
Mr. Bhushan said the verdict should not be delayed any longer, regardless of concerns about violence. “Public reaction, whatever it will be, has to be faced one day or the other,” he said. “This can’t be delayed because of fear.”
A three-judge panel in the capital of Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to hand down the verdict on Thursday afternoon. Speculation about the outcome varies widely, with some analysts hypothesizing that the judges may try to render the equivalent of a split decision. In Ayodhya, local residents are weary of the case, and the way it has come to define their city. Should his side lose, Mr. Ansari said he did not plan to appeal, but other parties may ultimately choose to take the case to India’s Supreme Court.
Mr. Ansari said he got involved so many years ago because he and his father had once prayed at the mosque. He said he remained on good terms with local Hindus who were involved on the other side of the case.
“I expect it will go in our favor,” he said of the verdict, “but it is up to the court.”

WASHINGTON — The House is expected to give the Obama administration another tool in its diplomatic pouch to pressure China to let its currency rise in value, reflecting growing concern around the country over the loss of manufacturing jobs, persistently high unemployment and a rising trade deficit.

Under Pressure
In what is likely to be one of Congress’s last significant measures before the election, the House will vote Wednesday on a symbolic but not insignificant measure threatening China with punitive tariffs on its imports to the United States.
In the past, Beijing has responded to such tactics by allowing its currency to rise gradually in relation to the dollar . Lately, though, efforts at cajoling the Chinese to revalue their currency have met with little, if any, response.
But it is unclear whether the legislation, which faces cloudy prospects in the Senate, will succeed this time in prodding  a China  that has become more self-confident  on the world stage. Some economists believe that Beijing has undervalued the currency, the renminbi , for about a decade to promote Chinese exports by making them cheaper.
“The legislation will strengthen the administration’s hand in its negotiations with China, but also risks provoking a strong backlash,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell and a former head of the International Monetary Fund ’s China division. “Ultimately its short-term effect is likely to be more symbolic than substantive.”
The strategy has borne fruit before. In July 2005, under pressure from a Republican-controlled Congress and the Bush administration, Chinese officials agreed to end the fixed peg of the renminbi to the dollar, allowing it to appreciate by more than 20 percent until July 2008, when they re-established the peg in response to global economic turmoil.
Now, with Democrats struggling to maintain their Congressional majorities, a Democratic president is pressing China on the issue. But so far the efforts have yielded little.
Lawrence H. Summers , one of President Obama ’s top economic advisers, and Thomas E. Donilon, deputy national security adviser, traveled to Beijing this month for three days of meetings with Chinese leaders but returned empty-handed on the currency issue.
Last Friday, Mr. Obama personally raised the issue with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao , on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York.
Since June, when China announced that it would permit greater exchange-rate flexibility, the renminbi has risen less than 2 percent against the dollar, with much of the increase occurring this month, amid rising Congressional anger and tough new rhetoric from the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner .
A weaker renminbi — estimates of the extent of the undervaluation range as high as 40 percent — makes Chinese exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive.
But in both countries, there are constituencies for and against currency revaluation.
In the United States, smaller manufacturers, labor unions and agricultural producers have been pressing the government to take a tough stance, saying that the currency policy has contributed to soaring trade deficits and the continued erosion of domestic industry.
But large multinational corporations, especially those with production plants in China, and Wall Street banks, are comfortable with a weak renminbi because they export goods from China or are trying to promote investment there.
In China, consumers would benefit from cheaper imports, and a stronger renminbi would help correct global economic imbalances that some economists say could lead to soaring inflation and asset bubbles. But export-oriented businesses and state-owned companies, which wield tremendous clout within the Communist regime, say the weak currency is vital for economic growth.
In recent weeks, the Obama administration, which had favored quiet diplomacy, has signaled to Congress that it was open to new measures.
Though he did not endorse the legislation, Mr. Geithner said at a House hearing this month that “it is very important that China hear from the Congress, from Republicans and from Democrats,” about the effect of China’s policies on American economic interests.
The Ways and Means Committee passed the bill on a voice vote on Friday.
Sponsored by Representatives Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the legislation would expand the Commerce Department’s ability to impose punitive duties on countries that undervalue their currencies to promote exports.
Experts expressed skepticism about the move; some believe it will merely antagonize the Chinese.
“Many people don’t think the multilateral steps have worked, that they’ve been tried, the talk has gone on, and nothing has happened,” Ira S. Shapiro, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig and a top trade negotiator during the Clinton administration, told House members this month. “I think it’s too early to reach that conclusion.”
Mr. Shapiro urged American officials to make the upcoming Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in November the focal point of multinational efforts to persuade China to move. If those talks fail, he said, the United States should pursue remedies at the World Trade Organization , which China joined in 2001.
Professor Prasad of Cornell  warned that if the Congressional proposal went forward, China could retaliate by limiting American imports or denying American manufacturers and financial institutions “the coveted prize of access to rapidly growing Chinese markets.”
Framing the issue as a dispute between the two countries, he added, “suits the Chinese well as it deflects attention from the global consequences of Chinese currency policy.”
Many economists believe that China is unlikely to budge without a concerted demonstration of international resolve. But such coordination is difficult when all countries are struggling to bolster their recoveries.
Two weeks ago, Japan devalued the yen , its first intervention in currency markets since 2004. The finance minister of Brazil, whose currency has soared in value, warned Tuesday that an “international currency war” was under way.
The International Monetary Fund has affirmed that China undervalues its currency, but lacks enforcement powers to give teeth to its reports. And the process for resolving disputes through the World Trade Organization is lengthy and uncertain.
All of those factors have made action by the House increasingly likely.

BANGKOK — The Web site of The Irrawaddy, a magazine based in Thailand that is a leading source of news and criticism of the junta in Myanmar, has come under attack and been blocked by hackers, its editor, Aung Zaw, said on Monday.
The “distributed denial of service” attack just after midnight was similar but more sophisticated than an attack that forced the temporary closing of the site two years ago. Mr. Aung Zaw said it was not clear whether the attack came from inside Myanmar or from China, a close ally. Visitors to the Web site, www.irrawaddy.org , have been redirected to a mirror site while technicians seek to restore it.
“This is a new game, a new frontier” in the government’s struggle against its opponents, Mr. Aung Zaw said. “It shows how vulnerable we are.”

SEOUL, South Korea — The youngest son of Kim Jong-il , North Korea ’s reclusive leader, has been promoted to a military general, that country’s official Korean Central News Agency reported early Tuesday, the clearest sign yet that he is in line to succeed his father as the country’s leader.
Enlarge This Image
A photo by Kenji Fujimoto, a Japanese who said he was a cook for Kim Jong-il, North Korea's leader, is said to show Kim Jong-un as a boy.
A brief dispatch by KCNA said the son, Kim Jong-un , and five others had been made generals in the Korea People’s Army. It was the first time that KCNA or any North Korean news outlet had mentioned the son, who is either 27 or 28, by name.
“This promotion of Kim Jong-un to four-star general carries a lot of weight in North Korea, and it has the connotation of very senior ‘top brass,’¬†” said Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea expert at the Fletcher School at Tufts University . “This is a very big deal.”
The new generals’ roster also included Kim Kyong-hui, the elder Mr. Kim’s sister. She is the wife of Jang Seong-taek, often regarded by outside analysts as the No. 2 man in the North and a potential caretaker for the government should Kim Jong-il, 68, who is in failing health, suddenly become incapacitated.
The news came hours after delegates to a rare gathering of the ruling Workers’ Party arrived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, on Monday as the party began final preparations for a meeting that could provide further signals about Kim Jong-un’s debut. Photographs from Pyongyang showed banners and posters announcing the meeting , and there has been heavy speculation in the South Korean news media about the possible anointing of the younger Mr. Kim .
Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, told reporters on Monday that the United States was “watching developments in North Korea carefully” and was talking to allies in the region “as we try to assess the meaning of what’s transpiring there.”
“But frankly, it’s still too early to tell in terms of next steps, or in fact, what’s going on inside the country’s leadership,” he said.
Little is known about Kim Jong-un, and most of what is has been culled from defectors and Web sites that collect information from sources in the North. In the North Korean news media he has been referred to as the “Young General,” “Youth Captain Kim” and even “C.N.C.,” short for computer numerical control, to demonstrate his bona fides as a leader for the 21st century. He is said to have attended boarding or military school in Switzerland and spent several years in the military.
Korea experts had long tapped his brother, Kim Jong-nam, 39, as the most likely heir, until he took an ill-fated trip to Tokyo Disneyland using a fake passport. All the same, Kim Jong-un might have remained an obscure figure, but his father had a stroke in 2008, quickening the timetable for the succession.
In a conservative Confucian society that reveres age, selling the public and, more important, the elite on a leader in his 20s is not easy. State-controlled media seem to be making a virtue of necessity, emphasizing not only Kim Jong-un’s computer expertise but also his freshness and youth, circulating songs, poems and posters singing his praises. He has lately accompanied his father on factory tours , and was said to have joined him on a recent trip to China.
The campaign may convince some of the people, experts say, but it is likely to have little impact on the elite, who will be testing his willingness to exercise power. Some in the West, including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , have ascribed the sinking of a South Korean warship by a North Korean torpedo attack in March to the succession struggle and Kim Jong-un’s efforts to establish credibility with the military brass.
Others, however, contend that the elite are quite comfortable with the idea of an inexperienced leader. “I think he is chosen exactly because he is young,” Andrei Lankov, a North Korean expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, said in an interview this month. “He will be a dictator, but merely a rubber-stamping dictator. This is what the people in the positions of power want.”
The party meeting was due to begin later Tuesday. Although the secretive government has said a new supreme leadership body will be elected, very little has been disclosed about the agenda.  The current gathering was originally announced by KCNA as scheduled for “early September,” and the slight delay touched off speculation about cutthroat internal wrangling over the presumed dynastic succession, Kim Jong-il’s health, and flooded roads and washed-out bridges that made travel difficult.
John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, was in Pyongyang last week for meetings with North Korean officials and said speculation was clearly starting to build around the meeting.
“This is a party meeting, and these are very rare in North Korean history,” he said in an interview on Monday.
Some analysts said they believed that Kim Jong-un was almost certain to be named his father’s successor and would perhaps be given one of eight Politburo seats. Others were more cautious, suggesting his ascendancy could still be undone by political infighting.
Kim Jong-il’s health has been the subject of much speculation. Some who have seen him in person say he appears wan and diminished, while others say he appears active and alert, despite a slight limp.
Daniel C. Sneider, associate director for research of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford, said, “At the very least, the last year tells us that Kim Jong-il knows he doesn’t have the kind of time to prepare his son for succession that he enjoyed.”
At the last Workers’ Party meeting in 1980, Kim Jong-il, then 38, was named to several party posts and confirmed as the sole successor to his father. All told, he had spent more than two decades learning the ropes when he finally took control upon the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994.

C.I.A. Steps Up Drone Attacks Within Pakistan (September 28, 2010)
The airstrikes, which took place last Friday and Saturday, were unusual because they involved piloted aircraft rather than drones , which are more commonly used to attack insurgents on the Pakistani side of the border, and which are normally operated by the Central Intelligence Agency .
Spokesmen for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force initially denied any of its forces had launched the airstrikes, although they were confirmed by Afghan police officials.
On Monday, however, a statement from the international force confirmed the attacks and put the death toll at more than 30. Initially, a base close to the border in Khost Province, known as Combat Outpost Narizah, came under fire from insurgents on Friday. When what the military described as an “air weapons team” responded, they came under fire from the insurgents on the Pakistani side of the frontier and returned fire, killing at least 30.
When two  helicopters from the international force returned to the area the next day, they were fired on again from the Pakistani side of the border, and again returned fire, killing several more insurgents, spokesmen said.
The Khost Provincial Police Chief, Gen. Abdul Hakim Isahqzai, put the death toll among the insurgents at 82 or higher. There have been no complaints of civilian casualties.
Coalition officials said the cross-border attacks fell within its rules of engagement because the insurgents had attacked them from across the border. The Associated Press reported that a third strike inside Pakistani territory was carried out by two NATO helicopters on Monday. Pakistani intelligence officials told The A.P. that the attack killed five militants and wounded nine others. Pakistan was reported on Monday to have criticized the strikes, denying American assertions that the United States has an agreement with Pakistan authorizing so-called “hot pursuit” raids a few miles across the border. In a press statement, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry said the mandate of NATO forces in Afghanistan did not extend beyond the border, The A.P. said.
The United States does carry out remotely-piloted drone strikes against militants on Pakistan’s border. The strikes, though unpopular with many Pakistanis, have had the tacit blessing of the Pakistani government since the end of the Bush administration. The latest such attack took place on Monday, killing two people near the Afghan border, The A.P. said.

BEIJING — The authorities are investigating a security company that helps local officials illegally detain desperate citizens who come to the capital to file complaints against them, the state news media reported Monday.
According to China Daily, an official English-language newspaper, the company’s employees posed as police officers and dragooned petitioners into “black jails,” where they were held and sometimes beaten until they could be hauled back to their homes in other provinces.
The Chinese government has repeatedly denied that such extralegal detention centers exist.
News about the company, Anyuanding Security Technology Service, was published by Caijing and Southern Metropolis Daily, two publications that often push beyond the boundaries that constrain much of China ’s official news media. According to their reports, the company, which earned $3.1 million in 2008, employs 3,000 “interceptors” whose job is to ensnare petitioners before they can reach the central government bureaus where grievances are filed.
According to Southern Metropolis Daily, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau detained two of Anyuanding’s executives and charged them with “illegally detaining people and illegally operating a business.” The police did not immediately respond to calls for comment on Monday. The company, whose Web site was taken down over the weekend, could not be reached.
The system of interceptors and black jails has flourished in recent years as Chinese citizens, frustrated by official malfeasance or illegal land seizures in their hometowns, come to the capital in the belief that their problems might be solved if they could gain the ear of senior leaders. Studies have shown, however, that problems are resolved for fewer than 2 percent of those who file petitions in Beijing.
Petitioning, allowed by Chinese law, has become a barometer of civic harmony — one that can affect the careers of local officials.
Because the central government rewards or punishes officials based on their ability to maintain social stability, those officials are eager to catch petitioners before they can lodge their complaints.
The interception efforts have apparently been successful. In its official report on human rights released Monday, the Chinese government cited a 3 percent drop in petition filings as proof that things had improved. It was the fifth consecutive decrease, the report said.
Human rights groups said they were encouraged by the detention of Anyuanding’s executives, but suggested that the system had become so entrenched that the changes would have to come from on high.
“The fact is that the problem of black jails goes far beyond one company,” Phelim Kine, an Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch , said in an e-mail. “It involves a web of government officials, security forces, huge numbers of plainclothes thugs and dozens of facilities in Beijing alone.”
According to the reports on Anyuanding, the kidnapped petitioners were taken to abandoned guesthouses, dank basements or rural compounds, where their cellphones and identity cards were confiscated until officials from their hometowns could come to fetch them. Some prisoners reported waiting more than a month.
The decision by Beijing’s public security bureau to take on the matter is significant given its first response. Last week, after Caijing published its investigation, several unidentified police officers pressed the magazine to reveal its sources, saying the article threatened “stability and unity,” according to the editors.
But after Caijing publicized the incident, Beijing’s new police chief, Fu Zhenghua, personally apologized to the deputy editor and assured him that no one on the staff would be punished.
Shortly afterward, the Anyuanding executives were detained.
Xu Zhiyong, a public interest lawyer whose organization has investigated black jails, said that although it was too early to say whether the police investigation signaled a change in official policy, it showed the effect that the media could have when given some latitude.
“The Anyuanding affair is so sinister and damaging, it appears that the public security authorities were left with little choice but to intervene and investigate,” Mr. Xu said.

NEW DELHI — The Indian government on Monday began the slow, uncertain process of trying to restore normalcy to the violence-racked region of Kashmir . Authorities reopened schools and universities, even as many students stayed away, some out of protest, others out of fear.

Times Topic: Kashmir
Monday marked the first test of the new political initiative announced by the Indian government over the weekend after more than three months of angry confrontation between stone-throwing protesters and Indian security officers. The demonstrations have left at least 108 people dead and coalesced into an angry rebuke of government policies in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
The package aimed at calming the situation includes economic aid, a call for easing security strictures and a new political dialogue.
Kashmir is a longtime source of dispute between India and Pakistan, with both countries controlling different parts of the region and claiming all of it. The latest unrest in the Indian portion, the state of Jammu and Kashmir, has been fueled by a rising call from students and others for political self-determination.
Since June, most educational institutions have remained closed in Kashmir, whether because of strikes called by separatist leaders or because of strict government curfews that had closed shops and cleared traffic off streets.
Reopening the schools was considered critical, and the state government announced that teachers with work cards and students in school uniforms would be allowed to pass through the myriad security checkpoints in the region’s summer capital of Srinagar. Bus schedules also were announced.
But on Monday there was an uneven response, with government officials estimating that 30 percent to 80 percent of students showed up for class throughout the Kashmir Valley.
Several students interviewed by telephone said they failed to attend because security officers refused to lift the curfew. At the University of Kashmir in Srinagar, Muhammad Ibrahim, 22, arrived at 10 a.m. for his first day back in 14 weeks. Yet he was the only student in his class of 38 who navigated the checkpoints and made it to school.
Showkat Shafi, spokesman for the university, said most classes on the main campus were closed Monday, while the curfew impeded other students from reaching satellite locations throughout the valley. He said students at the off-campus locations were supposed to begin taking examinations on Monday.
“Students are complaining that they are trying to reach examination centers across the valley, but very few have made it,” he said.
Many students also stayed away as a means of protest over their demands that India make good on promises to allow a referendum on self-rule in Kashmir. Some may have been following the separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who belittled the new government package and announced that families should not send their children back to school. Yet it is unclear how much control leaders like Mr. Geelani have over a protest movement fueled largely by college students.
“The government insists that we go to classes because they want to show the international community that things are normal here in Kashmir,” said Saliq Abbas, a postgraduate student at the University of Kashmir, who refused to return to classes. “But things are not normal.”
The impact of the new political package is likely to become clear only after several more weeks. Last Monday, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram led a parliamentary delegation on a two-day visit to the region and then announced the new policies from New Delhi late on Saturday afternoon.
On Monday, Mr. Chidambaram framed the efforts to reopen the schools in a positive light, noting that most had opened, while also criticizing a few minor reported episodes of stone throwing at school buses that resulted in no injuries.
“How can any right-thinking person pelt stones on school buses?” he asked in a statement.
Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, called on all political groups — including separatists like Mr. Geelani — to support the resumption of education. “Let us keep education neutral to all conflicts,” he said in a statement.
One of the most pressing questions is when, and to what degree, the authorities will ease the security lockdown that many residents in Srinagar describe as “collective punishment.”
Mr. Chidambaram’s package included a directive for state leaders to reassess the security presence and consider scaling back — a step previously promoted by Mr. Abdullah. Many Kashmiris want India to repeal emergency laws that have given broad powers of arrest and immunity to soldiers, paramilitary officers and police officers in many parts of the region.
Kuldeep Khoda, director of the state police, said decisions on security would be made after a meeting of the Unified Command, consisting of civilian leaders and leaders of security and military agencies.
He said the police had maintained a curfew in Srinagar on Monday as a protective measure against the threat of violence against schools or buses presented by Mr. Geelani’s call for a strike. The police did relax the curfew on Sunday to allow residents to rush out to buy food and other provisions.
The recent political attention on Kashmir has coincided with an almost complete absence of violence during the past week. Taj Mohi-ud-Din, a senior minister in the state government, predicted that more students would attend classes in the coming days, as the situation stabilized and parents became more comfortable with sending out their children. He also said that security would be eased in the future, as long as violence did not return.
“It has to be gradual,” he said. “We have to be certain the withdrawal will not affect the security position.”

Some 30,000 American soldiers are taking part in the Afghanistan surge. Here are the stories of the men and women of First Battalion, 87th Infantry.
For months, efforts at reconciliation have been stalled at every level, and this is the first explicit public suggestion that there is extensive behind-the-scenes contact between insurgents and the Afghan government.
Gen. David H. Petraeus , in a meeting with reporters after a tour of the largely United States-run detention facility here, where American forces detain Afghans they suspect of supporting the insurgency, said the Taliban were making efforts to establish contact with senior members of the Afghan government.
“There are very high-level Taliban leaders who have sought to reach out to the highest levels of the Afghan government and, indeed, have done that,” General Petraeus said.
The conditions of President Hamid Karzai “are very clear, very established, and, certainly, we support them as we did in Iraq, as the U.K. did in Northern Ireland; this is how you end these kinds of insurgencies,” General Petraeus said, referring to the conditions among others that the Taliban respect the country’s Constitution and lay down arms.
He added that any strategy had to be comprehensive and also include traditional elements of counterinsurgency strategy, like training Afghan security forces, and also “coming to grips with the situation in which there are sanctuaries for the insurgents outside the borders of the country in which we are located, and it involves, in a sense, a war of words, of information.”
American support for the process is in part a recognition that “Oh, by the way, you are not going to kill or capture your way out of an industrial-strength insurgency,” General Petraeus said, underscoring the scale of Taliban activity.
The talks are continuous, according to people knowledgeable about them.
General Petraeus’s embrace of talks comes at a difficult moment in the war and at a time when many politicians in the United States are searching for a way to bring the troops home as soon as possible. Popular support has ebbed amid a steady drumbeat of reports documenting the Taliban’s persistence despite the killing of large numbers.
Although on its face a peace deal with the Taliban appears to be a necessary ingredient for the withdrawal of international troops, a reconciliation with the insurgents is also so controversial among many Afghans that the United States is in a delicate position in supporting it. At this point it seems there is an acknowledgment that it would not be possible to win against an insurgency of this scale and that a peace deal might be a major part of any exit strategy.
A spokesman for Mr. Karzai confirmed that there had been contacts with the Taliban at every level, but he cautioned that the contacts could not be characterized as even the beginning of negotiations. “In the last few months, there have been signs and signals from different levels of Afghan Taliban,” said Waheed Omer, the spokesman.
“There have been different levels of contact — sometimes direct and sometimes indirect,” Mr. Omer said.
The outreach began shortly after the peace jirga , or assembly, in early June when Mr. Karzai announced his plans for a program of reintegration and reconciliation, but no formal negotiations or discussions have begun, he said.
Mr. Omer said Taliban figures had made numerous efforts to reach out, and that once the High Peace Council was appointed, which Mr. Karzai was expected to do this week, the efforts would proceed.  Similar efforts by emissaries of Mr. Karzai stalled after the capture of senior Taliban leaders by Pakistan in February. On a parallel track, but still in a formative stage, are efforts to reintegrate lower-level Taliban into Afghan society
“We’re on the cusp of beginning, of supporting, the Afghan beginning of reintegration,” General Petraeus said.

Workers began construction Sunday on a railway extension to connect the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, with the region’s second-largest city, Xigaze, state media reported. It is the first new leg on the Qinghai-Tibetan railway, an engineering feat opened in 2006 that has been hailed as an engine for Tibetan development — and criticized by some as a conduit for the migration of Han Chinese from the rest of the country. The 150-mile-long line will cost nearly $2 billion and take four years to complete, according to China Daily. Officials plan two more extensions, including a proposed route to the Nepal border.

An American teenager was charged with murder and destruction of evidence Monday after his mother was found dead at a resort in the western state of Rajasthan, the police and the suspect’s lawyer said. Joncarlo Patton, 16, had been arrested in Jodhpur, a Rajasthan tourist hub, on Aug. 13, a day after his mother, Cindy Iannarelli, of Cecil, Pa., was found with her throat slit at a resort in the nearby town of Osian. The youth’s lawyer, Manish Vyas, said the court would decide whether to charge his client under India ’s more lenient juvenile laws. A police superintendent, who questioned Joncarlo, said the attack occurred because he was traumatized by his parents’ divorce and wanted them to reconcile.

Some 30,000 American soldiers are taking part in the Afghanistan surge. Here are the stories of the men and women of First Battalion, 87th Infantry.
The National Security Agency’s wiretapping of Mahmoud Karzai, an older brother of President Karzai, appears to be part of a larger criminal investigation now under way by federal prosecutors in New York, according to the officials, who declined to be identified by name discussing a criminal inquiry.
Mahmoud Karzai, who ran restaurants in the United States before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is widely seen as one of the most powerful and well-connected business leaders in Kabul . He has been criticized in Afghanistan for taking advantage of his status as the brother of the president to engage in insider dealing in real estate, cement and other industries, and he has angered powerful officials in the Afghan Army by developing a lucrative residential real estate project on thousands of acres of valuable land in Kandahar that the army claims to own.
His role as an investor in Kabul Bank , Afghanistan’s largest commercial bank — which  was taken over by the country’s central bank in late August because of concerns about heavy losses — has brought increased scrutiny to his activities in both Washington and Kabul.
The N.S.A. wiretapping of Mr. Karzai in Afghanistan has been under way for at least several months, during a time when the crisis at the Kabul Bank was worsening.
The United States has created investigative teams with the Afghan government to fight corruption in the country, but the investigation of Mr. Karzai by federal prosecutors in New York appears to have been kept separate from that joint effort.
While the new joint anticorruption unit in Kabul has its own wiretapping capability, the fact that the N.S.A. has been involved in conducting surveillance of Mr. Karzai underscores the secrecy and sensitivity surrounding the investigation.
Gerald Posner , a lawyer for Mahmoud Karzai, said Monday that Mr. Karzai had not been contacted or interviewed by the F.B.I. or the Justice Department, and had not been told that he was the subject of an investigation.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that prosecutors had opened an inquiry into Mr. Karzai. Mr. Posner said that Mr. Karzai had canceled a planned trip to the United States.
The inquiry comes at an awkward time in the relationship between the Obama administration and the government of President Karzai. For months, the White House openly criticized President Karzai for tolerating widespread corruption that undermined the credibility of his government at a time when the United States was pouring more troops into the fight against the Taliban . But recently, the administration has begun to back off its anticorruption campaign out of a growing sense in Washington that it was having little effect other than to antagonize President Karzai and his political circle.
Until recently, another of President Karzai’s brothers, Ahmed Wali Karzai , received far more public scrutiny than Mahmoud Karzai. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the chairman of the provincial council of Kandahar who is widely considered to be the political boss of southern Afghanistan, has been accused of benefiting from narcotics trafficking , and United States officials have said that he also has had a longstanding relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency .
Mahmoud Karzai, by contrast, did not go into the Afghan government and has immersed himself in business. But several Karzai relatives have said that Mahmoud has been planning to form a new political party in Afghanistan and has been thinking about running for president when his brother’s term ends.
But as he has gained prominence, accusations of corrupt dealings have plagued  Mahmoud  Karzai. According to a person close to Mr.  Karzai, Senator John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, privately confronted President Karzai over Mr. Karzai’s business dealings in a recent meeting in Kabul. After the meeting, President Karzai called Mr. Karzai and questioned him, according to the person close to Mr. Karzai.
Mr. Karzai could not be reached for comment on Monday, but in an interview last week, he denied any wrongdoing, and said that all of his business dealings in Afghanistan were honest and that he was investing in Afghanistan’s future growth.
But even some of his relatives are critical of Mr.  Karzai’s aggressive style in Afghanistan.
“I have told him that he should have handled his business exactly the way we did in the U.S.,” said another Karzai brother, Qayum Karzai. Both Qayum and Mahmoud Karzai have owned and operated restaurants in the United States.
“He should not have had so much of a gray area around his business dealings,” Qayum Karzai said. “I personally have told him he should have had experts and lawyers look at his deals, and not just do it on handshakes and friendships, and make sure it doesn’t smell fishy, because you are the president’s brother.”

Some 30,000 American soldiers are taking part in the Afghanistan surge. Here are the stories of the men and women of First Battalion, 87th Infantry.
As part of its covert war in the region, the C.I.A. has launched 20 attacks with armed drone aircraft thus far in September, the most ever during a single month, and more than twice the number in a typical month. This expanded air campaign comes as top officials are racing to stem the rise of American casualties before the Obama administration’s comprehensive review of its Afghanistan strategy set for December. American and European officials are also evaluating reports of possible terrorist plots in the West from militants based in Pakistan.
The strikes also reflect mounting frustration both in Afghanistan and the United States that Pakistan’s government has not been aggressive enough in dislodging militants from their bases in the country’s western mountains. In particular, the officials said, the Americans believe the Pakistanis are unlikely to launch military operations inside North Waziristan, a haven for Taliban and Qaeda operatives that has long been used as a base for attacks against troops in Afghanistan. Some Pakistani troops have also been diverted from counterinsurgency missions to help provide relief to victims of the country’s massive flooding.
Beyond the C.I.A. drone strikes, the war in the region is escalating in other ways. In recent days, American military helicopters have launched three airstrikes into Pakistan that military officials estimate killed more than 50 people suspected of being members of the militant group known as the Haqqani network, which is responsible for a spate of deadly attacks against American troops.
Such air raids by the military remain rare, and officials in Kabul said Monday that the helicopters entered Pakistani airspace on only one of the three raids, and acted in self-defense after militants fired rockets at an allied base just across the border in Afghanistan. At the same time, the strikes point to a new willingness by military officials to expand the boundaries of the campaign against the Taliban and Haqqani network — and to an acute concern in military and intelligence circles about the limited time to attack Taliban strongholds while American “surge” forces are in Afghanistan.
Pakistani officials have angrily criticized the helicopter attacks, saying that NATO ’s mandate in Afghanistan does not extend across the border in Pakistan.
As evidence of the growing frustration of American officials, Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top American commander in Afghanistan, has recently issued veiled warnings to top Pakistani commanders that the United States could launch unilateral ground operations in the tribal areas should Pakistan refuse to dismantle the militant networks in North Waziristan, according to American officials.
“Petraeus wants to turn up the heat on the safe havens,” said one senior administration official, explaining the sharp increase in drone strikes. “He has pointed out to the Pakistanis that they could do more.”
Special Operations commanders have also been updating plans for cross-border raids, which would require approval from President Obama . For now, officials said, it remains unlikely that the United States would make good on such threats to send American troops over the border, given the potential blowback inside Pakistan, an ally.
But that could change, they said, if Pakistan-based militants were successful in carrying out a terrorist attack on American soil. American and European intelligence officials in recent days have spoken publicly about growing evidence that militants may be planning a large-scale attack in Europe, and have bolstered security at a number of European airports and railway stations.
“We are all seeing increased activity by a more diverse set of groups and a more diverse set of threats,” said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano before a Senate panel last week.
The senior administration official said the strikes were intended not only to attack Taliban and Haqqani fighters, but also to disrupt any plots directed from or supported by extremists in Pakistan’s tribal areas that were aimed at targets in Europe. “The goal is to suppress or disrupt that activity,” the official said.
The 20 C.I.A. drone attacks in September represent the most intense bombardment by the spy agency since January, when the C.I.A. carried out 11 strikes after a suicide bomber killed seven agency operatives at a remote base in eastern Afghanistan.
According to one Pakistani intelligence official, the recent drone attacks have not killed any senior Taliban or Qaeda leaders. Many senior operatives have already fled North Waziristan, he said, to escape the C.I.A. drone campaign.
Over all the spy agency has carried out 74 drone attacks this year, according to the Web site The Long War Journal , which tracks the strikes. A vast majority of the attacks — which usually involve several drones firing multiple missiles or bombs — have taken place in North Waziristan.
The Obama administration has enthusiastically embraced the C.I.A.’s drone program, an ambitious and historically unusual war campaign by American spies. According to The Long War Journal, the spy agency in 2009 and 2010 has launched nearly four times as many attacks as it did during the final year of the Bush administration.
One American official said that the recent strikes had been aimed at several groups, including the Haqqani network, Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. The United States, he said, hopes to “keep the pressure on as long as we can.”
But the C.I.A.’s campaign has also raised concerns that the drone strikes are fueling anger in the Muslim world. The man who attempted to detonate a truck filled with explosives in Times Square told a judge that the C.I.A. drone campaign was one of the factors that led him to attack the United States.
In a meeting with reporters on Monday, General Petraeus indicated that it was new intelligence gathering technology that helped NATO forces locate the militants killed by the helicopter raids against militants in Pakistan.
In particular, he said, the military has expanded its fleet of reconnaissance blimps that can hover over hide-outs thought to belong to the Taliban in eastern and southern Afghanistan.
The intelligence technology, General Petraeus said, has also enabled the expanded campaign of raids by Special Operations commandos against Taliban operatives in those areas.

Kuni Takahashi for The New York Times
Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, says it is willing to meet “the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies.”
But here in India , government authorities are well beyond the proposal stage. Prompted by fears of digital-era plotters, officials are already demanding that network operators give them the ability to monitor and decrypt digital messages, whenever the Home Ministry deems the eavesdropping to be vital to national security.
Critics, though, say India’s campaign to monitor data transmission within its borders will hurt other important national goals: attracting global businesses and becoming a hub for technology innovation.
The most inflammatory part of the effort  has been India’s threat to block encrypted BlackBerry services, widely used by corporations, unless phone companies provide access to the data in a readable format. But Indian officials have also said they will seek greater access to encrypted data sent over popular Internet services like Gmail, Skype and virtual private networks that enable users to bypass traditional telephone links or log in remotely to corporate computer systems.
Critics say such a threat could make foreigners think twice about doing business here. Especially vulnerable could be outsourcing for Western clients, like processing medical records or handling confidential research projects, information that is typically transmitted as encrypted data.
“If there is any risk to that data, those companies will look elsewhere,” said Peter Sutherland , a former Canadian ambassador to India who is now a consultant to North American companies doing business there.
S. Ramadorai, vice chairman of India’s largest outsourcing company, Tata Consultancy Services, echoed that sentiment in a newspaper column on Wednesday. “Bans and calls for bans aren’t a solution,” he wrote . “They’ll disconnect India from the rest of the world.”
Few doubt that India has valid security concerns. In recent years, attacks against India have included the use of sophisticated communications technology — as when the terrorists who stormed Mumbai two years ago communicated with their Pakistani handlers by satellite phone and the Internet. Or when Chinese hackers infiltrated India’s military computer networks this year.
But  critics say that India’s security efforts, which they describe as clumsy, may  do little to protect the country, even as they intrude on the privacy of companies and citizens alike.
“They will do damage by blocking highly visible systems like BlackBerry or Skype,” said Ajay Shah, a Mumbai-based economist who writes extensively about technology. “This will shift users to less visible and known platforms. Terrorists will make merry doing crypto anyway. A zillion tools for this are freely available.”
Senior Indian officials, though, argue that they have no choice but to demand the data that could help thwart and investigate terrorist attacks.
“All communications which is done by Indians or coming to and fro into India — and where we have a concern about national security — we should have access to it,” said Gopal Krishna Pillai, the secretary of India’s Home Ministry, which oversees domestic security.
During the Mumbai attacks, he said, officials could not gain access to some of the communications between the terrorists and their handlers.
Some legal experts indicate that Indian law — which has few explicit protections for personal privacy — is on the government’s side. But they also say India is trying to enforce the law in unnerving ways.
“The concern of corporate users and general users of BlackBerry is that if this is allowed, the government will become the single biggest repository of information,” said Pavan Duggal, a technology lawyer who practices before India’s Supreme Court . “And we have no idea how this information will be used and misused in the future.”
The Indian government has also clamped down on the importation of foreign telecommunications equipment, saying it wants to ensure that the technology does not contain malicious software or secret trap doors that could be used by foreign spies.
The technology and security debates playing out here are not new or unique to India.
During the 1990s, for instance, American security officials tried unsuccessfully to restrict the use of encryption because of worries that law enforcement would not be able to monitor communications. Now, in legislation the Obama administration plans to introduce next year, officials want Congress to require all services that enable communications — including encrypted e-mail systems like BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook and software that allows direct “peer to peer” messaging like Skype — to be technically able to comply if served with a wiretap order.
Currently, other countries including the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are trying to impose various measures similar to India’s.
The debate here, though, is complicated by the fact that despite private industry’s technology prowess in this country, in technologies like cryptography Indian law enforcement agencies still lag significantly behind their counterparts in the United States and other advanced countries.
The Indian government says it is intent on improving its code-cracking skills. But “in the interim, it has this very blunt instrument,” said Rajan S. Mathews, the director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India , a trade group. “It comes to the operators and says: ‘I’m going to make you responsible for giving me access,’¬†” he said.
Mr. Pillai, the Home Ministry secretary, said the government was not opposed to the use of encryption to protect the privacy of legitimate electronic communications. But he said that as government-licensed entities, network operators were obliged to give law enforcement officials a way to decode messages when required or to block communications that they cannot decipher.
But network providers say they may not always have the technical ability to do that. In much of the world — including for business users in India — companies and individuals now often use encryption systems that generate new code keys for each message and lack a convenient master key that could unlock everything for government viewing.
Google , for its part, has enhanced the encryption for its Gmail service, making it harder for hackers and the Indian government to read messages. Mr. Pillai said his ministry had begun conversations with Google and Skype, the Internet phone company, which also uses strong encryption, to provide access to decoded data.
Representatives for Google and Skype said that they could not comment because they had not yet received formal demands from the Indian government.
Meanwhile, government officials have demanded that the maker of BlackBerry, Research In Motion of Canada, set up a server computer in India from which law enforcement agencies can gain access to unencrypted versions of messages when they need to. The government has given R.I.M. until the end of October to comply.
The company has said that it is willing to meet “the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies.” But the company says it cannot provide unencrypted copies of messages of corporate users because of how the BlackBerry system is designed, noting that even R.I.M. cannot decode them.
“Strong encryption has become a mandatory requirement for all enterprise-class wireless e-mail services today,” R.I.M. said in a statement in late August, “and is also a fundamental commercial requirement for any country to attract and maintain international business.”

Singapore Looks to China for Food Security

SINGAPORE — Singapore is eyeing a gigantic farming project in northeast China that could help the small, densely populated city-state diversify its food supplies, while offering export opportunities for its expertise in food safety and investment opportunities for its businesses.
One company, Singapore Food Industries, has already announced a joint venture to set up an integrated pig farm as part of the project. Another, Singbridge International Singapore, is studying the commercial feasibility of a joint venture in developing a giant food production zone jointly with the Jilin municipality.
The China Jilin (Singapore) Modern Agricultural Cooperation Food Zone is an ambitious project covering 1,450 square kilometers, or 560 square miles, twice the area of Singapore. It is envisioned as a major food production center integrating farming with food processing, storage and logistics.
“There are similar large-scale projects now being worked on around the world, but this is a world’s first in terms of joint regional private-public sector partnership,” said Veiverne Yuen, associate director in the Food & Agribusiness Research and Advisory Asia team at Rabobank. Mr. Yuen was project manager of a conceptual feasibility study conducted by Rabobank for the food zone.
In May, the Jilin Provincial People’s Government announced the inauguration of the food zone, which it described as a “major collaborative project” to improve food security and food safety for both Singapore and China.
For a start, the project will explore the feasibility of setting up a disease-free zone for producing pork for export to Singapore, said Goh Shih Yong, spokesman for Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority, or A.V.A., the Singapore food regulator.
Singapore currently imports more than 90 percent of the food it needs to feed its five million residents and the more than nine million tourists who visit every year.
According to A.V.A. data, Singapore imports 96,200 tons of pork a year, mainly from Brazil, Indonesia and Australia. It also relies heavily on Australia for mutton and beef. It is looking to the Chinese venture both to diversify its food supplies and to increase their security.
The pig farm is a joint venture of Singapore Food Industries; the DaChan Food (Asia) Co., based in Hong Kong, one of the largest chicken meat products and feed suppliers in China; and the state-owned Jilin China-Singapore Food Zone Development Construction Investment Co., or J.C.S.
Ground-breaking started this month, and when the farm is completed over the next six years, it is intended to incorporate a supply sequence starting with feed production and breeding and running through slaughtering and meat processing, that could process a million pigs each year.
“Pork is one of the main sources of protein, especially for the majority of the Chinese population in Singapore. The project will leverage on the geographical and resource advantages of Jilin City to secure a safe, reliable and sustainable supply of pork for the Singapore market,” said Poon Choon Liang, chief operating officer of Singapore Food Industries.
“Diversification helps us tackle the food challenges that affect global food supply and demand in the future. It is a key strategy in ensuring a resilient supply as it enables our traders to quickly switch to alternative sources and at the most competitive prices,” he said.
Singapore has always tried to diversify its food sources as part of a strategy to stabilize local food prices .
It intensified those diversification efforts in 2008, establishing new sources for pork in a number of countries, including Poland, Mexico and Spain. It also brought in live fish from Namibia and processed poultry from Turkey, China and other countries.
Mr. Yuen said that the availability of pig feed near the Jilin farm should enable it to produce pork at a lower cost.
More important, the pig farm will be surrounded by a zone free of foot and mouth disease , to be established and monitored by the A.V.A. following guidelines set out by the World Organization for Animal Health.
“The A.V.A. is recognized as one of the world’s top institutions with regards to control of animal health and safety in food manufacturing. That’s because, as a single entity, it can streamline controls, unlike most other countries where these different aspects of food safety are spread across different government organizations,” Mr. Yuen said.
To establish and maintain the disease-free zone, bio-security checkpoints will be set up to ensure that people disinfect their hands, clothes and footwear when entering or leaving farms.
Disease surveillance procedures will also have to be put in place, involving the collection of samples from livestock for testing, to check for contamination by circulating infections, Mr. Ong said.
Under the agreement, the disease-free zone is expected to be established at the end of 2011. The zone is to be officially recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture in China and endorsed by the A.V.A.
Jilin, which lies in the central part of northeast China, bordering Russia to the east and North Korea to the southeast, is one of the world’s most productive corn-growing regions, currently producing 20 percent of the corn grown in China.
Yet the corn-belt region is producing well below its capacity.
“Agronomically, the climatic and the soil characteristics are very similar to what you have in the corn belt in the Midwest in the United States, so it’s very fertile black soil with optimal climatic conditions in terms of temperature and rainfall to grow feed grains,” Mr. Yuen said. “But on the ground, the level of applied technology is still lagging what you have in the developed world, so there is a lot of room to improve.”
Harvests could be substantially raised by building more infrastructure, including irrigation systems; by introducing modern farm management methods; and by using industrialized farm machinery, he said.
“We believe you could actually increase the corn yield in that region by anywhere from 50 to 80 percent.”

Health Guide: Rabies
But subscribers to ProMED , a disease-outbreak Web site, have pointed out another contributing factor: in the mountainous rural northern provinces where the problem is worst, many people are fond of eating dogs.
Most rabies is transmitted by bites from stray dogs. The disease kills about 55,000 people a year around the world, mostly children under 15, according to the World Health Organization .
In parts of Vietnam, according to the national government, only one dog out of 25 is vaccinated, and there is a regular cross-country trade in dogs for the table. (Raising dogs for meat is popular in many countries , especially in southeast Asia and West Africa .)
A study in the journal PLoS Medicine last year described the deaths of two rabies patients in Vietnamese hospitals . Neither had been bitten, but one had cut up and cooked a dog killed in a traffic accident, while the other had eaten a sick cat.
Many Vietnamese refuse to eat vaccinated dogs, said Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People, an animal protection magazine, because the only vaccines locally available are grown in sheep brains using an outdated method invented by Louis Pasteur. If improperly stored, those vaccines can give rabies to the dog, and in turn to the diner.

177;"The Lede Blog: U.S. Soldier Charged in Murder of Afghans Was a Whistleblower, Father Says (September 10, 2010)
The testimony, in a hearing to determine whether one of those soldiers, Specialist Jeremy N. Morlock, would face a court-martial and a possible death sentence, came the same day that a videotape in the case was leaked showing Specialist Morlock talking to investigators about the killings in gruesome detail with no apparent emotion.
Top Army officials worry that the case against Specialist Morlock and four other soldiers accused in the killings of three Afghan civilians will undermine efforts to build relationships with Afghans in the war against the Taliban .
The soldiers are accused of possessing dismembered body parts, including fingers and a skull, and collecting photographs of dead Afghans. Some images show soldiers posing with the dead. As many as 70 images are believed to be in evidence.
Some of the soldiers have said in court documents that they were forced to participate in the killings by a supervisor, Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, who is also accused in the killings. All five defendants have said they are not guilty.
In one incident, Specialist Morlock recounted in the video, he described Sergeant Gibbs identifying for no apparent reason an Afghan civilian in a village, then directing Specialist Morlock and another soldier to fire on the man after Sergeant Gibbs lobbed a grenade in his direction.
“He kind of placed me and Winfield off over here so we had a clean line of sight for this guy and, you know, he pulled out one of his grenades, an American grenade, popped it, throws the grenade, and tells me and Winfield: ‘All right, wax this guy. Kill this guy, kill this guy,’¬†” Specialist Morlock said in the video.
Referring to the Afghan, the investigator asked: “Did you see him present any weapons? Was he aggressive toward you at all?”
Specialist Morlock replied: “No, not at all. Nothing. He wasn’t a threat.”
As Monday’s hearing was getting under way, CNN and ABC News broadcast the video. In the CNN clip and the ABC clip, Specialist Morlock, speaking in a near monotone, looks like a teenager recounting a story to his parents.
CNN also broadcast video of the interview of a soldier who is not accused in the killings but has been accused of lesser crimes, Cpl. Emmitt R. Quintal.
When asked by an investigator when and how often members of the unit used illegal drugs, Corporal Quintal, seated in camouflage fatigues, said it occurred on “bad days, stressful days, days that we just needed to escape.”
The interview with Specialist Morlock was conducted in Kandahar in May, while he was en route to a medical evaluation for what his lawyers said was possibly a traumatic brain injury suffered during his deployment. They say he was taking medication prescribed by military doctors for sleep deprivation, pain and muscle stress, though they said they could not yet establish exactly when he had taken the medication and how it might have affected him.
Specialist Morlock, who grew up in Wasilla, Alaska, appeared in court on Monday but did not testify.
Michael Waddington, his lawyer, questioned Army investigators by phone from their duty station in Afghanistan. Mr. Waddington repeatedly asked whether they found Specialist Morlock to be under the influence of medication in the interviews. Some investigators described Specialist Morlock as tired and sometimes slouching, but they said he was coherent and had a strong recollection of details.
The video, provided to defense lawyers to help them prepare their cases, was not intended by the military to be made public.
“The disclosure of these video recordings is troubling because it could adversely affect the military justice process,” said Col. Tom Collins, an Army spokesman.
The power of images in the case was apparent last week, when the commander of the Stryker brigade in which the soldiers serve ordered photographic evidence to be strictly controlled by investigators at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, with access limited to lawyers.
A memo circulated by a military defense lawyer the previous week described an inadvertent release of photographs, including three that show American soldiers holding up the heads of dead Afghans. It was unclear whether all of the pictures showed soldiers in the cases, though military prosecutors said Monday that Specialist Morlock was in at least one image, apparently with a dead Afghan.
Photographic evidence could play an important role in the Army’s case, as will statements from soldiers. No bodies have been recovered, and a military investigator testified on Monday that the nature of the areas where the crimes occurred, including religious views of residents and potential danger to American soldiers, prevented them from conducting crime scene investigations.
“To exhume a body would cause a lot of issues, even if it was for a good purpose,” said Special Agent Anderson D. Wagner.
Mr. Wagner noted that at least two statements, from Specialist Morlock and another soldier charged, Pfc. Adam C. Winfield, corroborated elements of each other’s story. He also said there was little physical evidence connecting the soldiers to the killings. “I don’t know the final thing that killed those guys, whether it was a bullet or whose grenade it was,” Mr. Wagner said.
The Army’s case is complicated by claims that it ignored warnings that there was trouble in the unit. Private Winfield’s father has said he repeatedly tried to alert military officials that his son had told him through Facebook in February that a murder was committed by members of his unit in January. The soldiers are accused of killings in January, February and May.
Mr. Waddington said in an interview that his client was present where the three crimes are said to have taken place, but that he had not killed anyone.
Mr. Wagner, the investigator, said that during his interview in May, Specialist Morlock had feared retaliation for talking.
Lawyers for Specialist Morlock told reporters during a break that the case reflected a “failed policy” in Afghanistan, and that soldiers like Specialist Morlock should never have been allowed to continue with their unit given the medication they say he was on and the alleged widespread use of drugs in the unit. Seven other soldiers in the unit are accused of other crimes, including hashish possession.
It could be weeks before the military investigator presiding over the hearing, Judge Thomas Molloy, determines how to charge Specialist Morlock.
Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.
Correction: September 29, 2010
An article on Tuesday about a hearing in military  court in Washington State related to allegations that members of a  United States Army unit killed three Afghan civilians misstated, in some  editions, the rank of one of the soldiers, Jeremy N. Morlock. He is a  specialist, not a corporal.

ARGHANDAB, Afghanistan — American and Afghan troops began active combat last week in an offensive to drive the Taliban out of their strongholds surrounding the city of Kandahar, military officials said Sunday.

Active combat began last week in three districts. More Photos ¬ª
In the last several days, soldiers shifted from guarding aid workers and sipping tea with village elders to actively hunting down Taliban fighters in marijuana fields and pomegranate orchards laced with booby traps.
Sixteen Americans have died in the push so far, including two killed by a roadside bomb on Sunday.
The combat phase began five or six days ago in the Arghandab, Zhari and Panjwai Districts, Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, a NATO spokesman in Kabul, said, defining the current phase for the first time.
“We expect hard fighting,” he said of the offensive, whose objective is to clear the Taliban from three districts to the west and south of the city.
Winning over Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, is considered crucial to President Obama ’s efforts to shift the balance of power in Afghanistan after the militants’ comeback of recent years.
“This is the most significant military operation ongoing in Afghanistan,” General Blotz, who is with the International Security Assistance Force of NATO, said, calling it the “top operational priority now.”
This is the first large-scale combat operation involving multiple objectives in Kandahar Province, where a military offensive was originally expected to begin in June. That offensive was downgraded to more of a joint civil-military effort after the military encountered problems containing the Taliban in the much smaller city of Marja and because Afghan leaders feared high civilian casualties.
During the last week of August, at the instigation of Afghan authorities, American troops supported a major push into the Mehlajat area on the southwest edge of Kandahar City, driving the Taliban from that area with few casualties on either side.
At the time, military officials said that was the beginning of what would be an increase in active combat around Kandahar.
Bismillah Khan, the police chief in the Zhari District, confirmed that the combat operation there began on Saturday, but he declined to give further details. Some of the heaviest fighting has been in Zhari, where troops have been told to avoid contact with local people because of widespread hostility toward foreign forces there.
Zhari is the hometown of the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar , and it also sits astride the strategic Highway 1, connecting Kandahar with Helmand Province to the west.
Often the soldiers there run what are known as “move to contact” patrols that have no goal but to draw fire from the Taliban so aircraft can find and kill them.
Last Tuesday, a United States Army platoon left Forward Operating Base Wilson early in the morning and within 10 minutes, Taliban insurgents had opened fire with small arms, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
Although helicopter gunships were soon overhead to support the ground forces, the insurgents continued to fire on the patrol throughout the day as the troops made their way through vineyards and fields of marijuana plants 10 feet high.
None of the Americans were wounded or killed on that patrol.
Journalists from The New York Times, during a weeklong stay there, observed that every time soldiers left their bases, they were either shot at or hit with bombs, often hidden or booby-trapped.
Frequently, the Taliban did not — as they normally would — stop shooting once air support arrived.
Soldiers on a recent patrol, clearing up after one bomb explosion, discovered that a piece of debris lodged in a tree had itself been rigged with a tripwire, practically under their noses.
Here in Arghandab, the flow of troops has made it possible to begin trying to take control of an area where thick vegetation, irrigation canals and pomegranate orchards provide good cover for the Taliban, according to Lt. Col. Joseph Krebs, deputy commander for the Second Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, but the results have been mixed.
No sooner had the First Battalion of the 22nd Armored Regiment of the Army arrived here than five soldiers were killed on Aug. 30, by a roadside bomb directed at their convoy. The dead included the first Army chaplain to be killed in active duty during the Afghan conflict.
The chaplain, Capt. Dale A. Goetz, 43, had been on a tour of some of the 18 combat outposts the military has established in the Arghandab District.
Three days later, rockets fired from orchards just outside the district center hit the dining tent at the main American base, slightly wounding five soldiers.
While no official casualty totals have been released for the recent operations in the Kandahar districts, American military reports list 16 American fatalities in the Kandahar area since Aug. 30, at least 10 of which were in the Arghandab or Zhari Districts.
An effort to bring all of the heavily Pashtun south under coalition control began on Feb. 14 with an attempt to suppress the Taliban in and around Marja. Kandahar was to be the next target.
But the Taliban in Marja have still not been subdued, so officials decided to concentrate first on bringing economic development to some districts around Kandahar city, then on gradually stepping up military operations.
“I look at each one of my 13 combat platoons as a development team,” said Lt. Col. Rodger Lemons, commander of the First Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, stationed at the district headquarters here.
“I’m not going to tell you the population is fully in support, but they are much more in support of the government and the coalition than they are of the Taliban,” he said.
Along with the military buildup has come a similar effort to increase the presence of State Department employees, along with aid contractors paid by the Americans, who would serve as stabilization teams in those areas.
Although some 300 American civilian staff members have arrived in Kandahar Province, at the district levels there are only a few,  mainly because of security concerns.
In Arghandab, where the civilian effort is deemed to have been the most successful, the district team consists of two Americans in addition to contractors and local employees.
“It’s hard to get people to come here,” said Kevin Melton, who is finishing up a yearlong tour running the State Department team in Arghandab.
When Mr. Melton arrived, the district government was not functioning.  Now, there is an active shura or village council, with people coming to the district government’s building regularly, attracted by generous aid programs.
“Five dead and that’s the news that gets out,” Mr. Melton said, referring to the first fatalities in Arghandab. “Yeah, we know what’s going wrong, but look what’s going right. If we had done this eight years ago, would we have been here now?”
By comparison, other districts like Zhari and Panjwai are just getting started, he said.

179;"Jiang Kehong/Xinhua, via Associated Press
Zhan Qixiong, second from right, the captain of a Chinese trawler, arrived in Fuzhou, China, on Saturday.
The Japanese request was effectively a retort to China’s demand that Japan apologize and offer compensation for the episode, even after Japan had freed the captain last Friday in what was widely seen as a capitulation to placate an increasingly assertive China.
On Sunday, Japan’s prime minister, Naoto Kan , called China’s latest demands “unthinkable,” a sign of his sensitivity to criticism that Japan had shown timidity to Chinese bullying.
“Naturally, we will be asking for the boats to be returned to their original condition,” the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told a news conference here on Monday.
The Japanese release of the captain seemed aimed at defusing a heated standoff in which China had imposed economic sanctions and even detained four Japanese.
But the Japanese were clearly surprised when China then said that Tokyo must offer an apology and unspecified compensation over the arrest, which took place almost three weeks ago and aroused deep anger in China.
The demands have forced Mr. Kan to decide once again whether Tokyo will stand up to Beijing, which in recent years has appeared to be testing Japan’s resolve to back its territorial claims in the East China Sea.
In the days leading up to the captain’s release, the Chinese curtailed tourism to Japan, suspended many political and cultural ties, and took unannounced steps to restrict shipments to Japan of rare-earth minerals, which are important components for a range of industrial products.
But the move that Japan found most alarming was the detention in the northern city of Shijiazhuang of the four Japanese citizens, accused of photographing military sites.
The dispute illustrated the difficulty of overcoming nationalistic sentiments stirred up by the trawler episode, which is affecting the deeply intertwined ties between the two neighbors, the world’s second- and third-largest economies, after that of the United States. It also raised concern across Asia about China’s willingness to use its growing economic clout for political gains.
Japanese leaders had sought to minimize the episode, saying that the Chinese captain’s release was a decision made by local prosecutors. Those assertions were met with broad skepticism, with many here holding the view that Japan capitulated to aggressive Chinese pressure.
This has led to growing criticism in Japan that Mr. Kan’s government showed weakness. “It looks like Japan caved in,” said Sadakazu Tanigaki, the head of the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats. “That sends the wrong signal to China.”

KABUL, Afghanistan — Four aid workers for the United States Agency for International Development were kidnapped by gunmen on one of the country’s major highways on Sunday, according to embassy and police officials.
The provincial police chief, Gen. Khalilullah Ziayee, said the four, a British woman and three Afghan men, were stopped as they drove in two cars on the road from Jalalabad to Asadabad in Kunar Province, in the east of the country, and were taken away at gunpoint.
“We don’t know who picked them up, but Taliban and Hezb-e-Islami fighters are active in the area,” General Ziayee said.
Steven O’Connor, a spokesman for DAI , an American company that works exclusively for Usaid in Afghanistan , said the British woman and one of the Afghans were DAI employees, and the other two Afghan men were drivers whose employment status was unclear.
A British Embassy spokeswoman confirmed that a British citizen was missing in Afghanistan, “and the embassy, working with other internationals, is urgently investigating the reports.” She spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy.
General Ziayee said the four “did not coordinate their trip with Afghan national security forces.”
There have been three kidnappings this year of aid workers in Kunar Province, all of whom worked for nonprofit organizations. All were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.
An Afghan employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Nangarhar Province.

181;"China Rights Report Cites Improvements, but Also Failings
By IAN JOHNSON
BEIJING — China released a report on human rights on Sunday, highlighting the country’s willingness to deal with the highly contentious issue but also the differences between its perceptions of human rights and those of many other countries.

Times Topic: China
The report acknowledged that China suffers from large inequalities in its practice of human rights, and that “there is still much room for improvement in its human rights conditions.” But it said that the country had made large strides despite difficult economic times.
Published on the Internet in Chinese and English , the report lists achievements in a variety of fields, including the growing role of the Internet. It noted that many government agencies now routinely use the Web to gauge public opinion, and highlighted a new law passed this year to outlaw police brutality and torture after expos√©s in the local press about the abuse of detainees.
Outside human rights groups said that these steps were real and that China deserved credit for them, but they pointed to what they said was the country’s history of passing laws that are not enforced. “China deserves credit for taking that step of making new rules where they didn’t exist before,” said Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights group in Hong Kong. “But that can’t stand for actual results. The legislation itself needs to be enforced before you can measure its impact.”
Assessing enforcement is difficult because the government outlaws independent human rights monitors.
Over all, the report contrasts sharply with outside assessments. This year, the United States State Department found in its annual review of human rights that the situation in China remained “poor and worsened in some areas.”
Part of the reason for these widely divergent opinions has to do with China’s definitions of human rights. Much of its report was taken up with a detailed discussion on the economic rights of the Chinese people and how the growing economy was raising living standards and providing better education. Many international human rights organizations consider these rights, while important, to be a separate category. For China, however, they are at least on a par with rights like free speech and the right to assemble and to vote without intimidation.
Despite those differing views, some critics were encouraged.
“It is positive because people will talk about it and it gets in the local media,” said Wan Yanhai, a public health activist who recently left China because of harassment. “But it is publicized by the government for outsiders.”

KUALA LUMPUR — With the Islamic finance industry worth an estimated $1 trillion and growing rapidly, it is perhaps no surprise that a number of Asia-Pacific nations are among a growing band of countries worldwide to signal their intention to carve out a larger share of the market.

M.I.T. Weighs Charges for Online Lectures (September 27, 2010)
Countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, along with Hong Kong, have set their sights on becoming hubs for Islamic finance, where investments are made according to Islamic principles. (Under Shariah , or Islamic law, charging interest and making investments in industries like gambling and alcohol are forbidden.)
While their  sectors may be at varying stages of development, they are facing a common predicament: a shortage of professionals skilled in Islamic finance.
Education institutions around the Asia-Pacific region, like their counterparts in the Middle East and Europe, are increasingly seeking to fill that gap by adding Islamic finance specialization to their master’s programs in business administration and elsewhere.
The number of such courses available in Kuala Lumpur, home to the most developed Islamic finance sector in the region, is growing rapidly. A number of business schools now offer Islamic finance components as part of their M.B.A. programs, and the Universiti Tun Abdul Razak, a private institution in Kuala Lumpur, will offer a new M.B.A. in Global Islamic Finance for students enrolled for the semester starting in October.
Malaysia’s International Center for Education in Islamic Finance, which was established by the central bank in 2006, is working with a growing number of universities around the region and elsewhere to help them start Islamic finance courses.
The center, which teaches its own programs, including master’s and doctoral degrees, has already worked with universities in Malaysia, Indonesia and Britain, and is fielding a growing number of inquiries from institutions around the world, from South Korea and Hong Kong to France and Germany.
The president and chief executive of the center, Agil Natt, said Islamic finance was now considered a viable alternative to conventional finance, and business schools were responding to industry demand for skilled professionals.
“People are beginning to clamor for more qualified people,” he said. “Suddenly it dawned on the universities that this is a growing market.”
The new M.B.A. in Global Islamic Finance at the Universiti Tun Abdul Razak will be available to all students enrolled in the International Business School Alliance, a grouping of universities from Germany, Spain, Russia, the United States, Britain and Malaysia.
Students who choose the Islamic finance specialization will study core M.B.A. subjects for their first semester at the university of their choice, followed by a semester of Islamic finance subjects like the application of Islamic commercial law and Islamic banking products, at the Malaysian university. Students will conduct research into an aspect of Islamic finance, like the sector’s regulatory systems, in their third semester.
Ong Fon Sim, dean of the university’s Graduate School of Business, said it decided to introduce the one-year, full-time program to meet the growing demand for Islamic finance professionals.
“It’s the government’s aspiration to make Malaysia into a global Islamic finance center,” she said. “Islamic finance and banking is here to stay. Everybody recognizes that. Because of that, we think there should be demand.”
In Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, the University of Indonesia began offering a Master’s in Islamic Banking last year after the country’s central bank asked the school to develop courses to help prepare students for the industry, said Professor Firmanzah, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
The school also offers an Islamic banking specialization for M.B.A. students and plans to offer a bachelor’s in Islamic banking and a doctoral program next year. “We are focusing on Islamic banking since the growth of Islamic banking in Indonesia is quite high compared to traditional banks,” he said.
Islamic finance education is spreading beyond the region’s Muslim-majority countries. La Trobe University in Melbourne started Australia’s first Master’s in Islamic Banking and Finance this year, and has begun offering Islamic finance as an M.B.A. elective.
The Master’s program has attracted students from as far away as Vietnam, Hong Kong, the United States, Pakistan, India and Saudi Arabia, said Ishaq Bhatti, director of the program.
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Business School introduced an Islamic finance elective as part of its M.B.A. program in April.
John Wei, director of the program, said the university decided to offer the elective after observing the increasing influence and economic potential of Islamic countries.
The spread of Islamic finance education is a trend the industry hopes will continue to pick up speed to help meet the growing need for skilled professionals, said Rithuan Mohamed Shamsudin, executive director of the Association of Islamic Banking Institutions Malaysia.

TOKYO — In a country with a shrinking population, the latest trend in Japan ’s higher education is something of a mystery: the number of universities and academic programs is rising. The growth is sharpest for professional graduate schools, where the number has soared from practically zero in 2003, when accreditation began, to 130 now, in fields ranging from law and business to clinical counseling and education.

M.I.T. Weighs Charges for Online Lectures (September 27, 2010)
But there is one obvious problem: not enough students are signing up.
The Japanese government says that nearly half of professionally oriented programs, aside from law schools, have yet to fill their stated student capacity. And the problem has been especially acute in graduate programs in education.
Interest in many professional schools has been less than overwhelming, said Kenichi Yoshida, an executive senior consultant at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, which is affiliated with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
“Japanese universities tend to roll out programs without having a good grasp of the needs in the marketplace,” said Mr. Yoshida, who watches Japan’s higher education. “When they start a program, they assume there will be students.”
In Japan, the need for graduate programs seems undeniable: lifetime employment is crumbling, employers are committing less time and money to training young workers, and social problems are becoming more complex, increasing the need for experts.
Setting up graduate programs in education was the universities’ answer to a growing dissatisfaction with the primary and secondary school system.
“We are faced with a number of gripping issues in schools like bullying, truancy, and falling grades,” said Tetsuya Kajisa, the president of Hyogo University of Teacher Education near Osaka. “As society and community change, issues facing schools have become more complicated and the solutions require higher expertise.”
In 2008, with the blessing and the accreditation of the Ministry of Education, 19 universities launched professionally oriented graduate programs in teacher education, seeking approximately 700 students in total. Seven more schools introduced similar programs a year later.
During the first year, 8 of the 19 original institutions fell short of the target enrollment — some by far: two schools managed to recruit only half of the target numbers of students. A ministry assessment completed shortly afterward said the schools lacked proper marketing methods and had failed to clearly state the practical benefits of receiving graduate diplomas.
Mr. Kajisa, who also heads an association for professional schools for teacher education, said the system for teachers needed to be revised so that people with graduate degrees would get recognition through promotions or through some sort of licensing system that required taking graduate courses to upgrade a license, as is the case in the United States.
“There have to be initiatives taken at the national level” to create benefits to those with graduate certificates, he said, “because these schools were envisioned by the national government.”
Currently, local school districts have different policies regarding promotions and benefits for teachers with graduate degrees.
Some schools are taking their own measures to increase enrollment. “We have gone around visiting undergraduate departments giving explanatory sessions and did what we could to let people know about our programs,” said Hirokazu Hirose, a professor in the graduate program at Joetsu University of Education in Niigata Prefecture.
The graduate school has also been placing an emphasis on practical training, for example, sending students to teach at local primary and secondary schools.
Students teach lessons at local schools, videotape the classes and then bring the tapes back for evaluation with other students. “Then we feed the solutions back to the classes,” Mr. Hirose said. “Essentially, what we do is identify issues, find the solutions and resolve issues in the classroom.”
Following the efforts by Mr. Hirose and 20 of his colleagues, the number of students enrolled grew from 32 in 2008 to 51 in 2009 at his graduate program. In 2010, the school enrolled 60 students.
A number of graduate students interviewed, many of whom have had years of teaching experience before coming to the graduate programs, generally held positive views about the in-class training.
“It allowed me to structure and organize my knowledge and experiences,” said Kazuhiko Nishimura, 49, a graduate student at Hyogo University of Teacher Education and a high school social studies teacher in the southern Yamaguchi Prefecture, currently on leave.
Mr. Nishimura said he liked his graduate school’s integrated approach to practice and theory, something he said was often missing among front-line teachers. “You need to understand the latest studies and theories in order to understand and overcome latest problems,” he said.
Mr. Nishimura, who has another six months to complete his master’s degree, is due to carry out 150 hours of work at a high school in his native Yamaguchi starting this autumn, including management training with the principal and teaching classes.
Takanori Matsuoka, 39, a student at Joetsu and an elementary school teacher on leave, said that the mix of practice and theory worked well. “I have had few opportunities to think theoretically about issues before,” he said. “What was significant was that I got to learn about something I had direct experiences in at school from a fresh theoretical perspective.”
Students said they thought more teachers would be interested in enrolling if they had been given the opportunity to know more about what these professional schools actually did.
But some say that egalitarian thinking, typical of Japan’s group-oriented society, might stand in the way. If there was one main reason keeping teachers from attending, “it would be that teachers in Japanese schools have this notion that they tackle problems by working together, not by creating a super elite that transcends everybody,” Mr. Matsuoka said.

184;"Asia Begins Embracing Solar Power
By BETTINA WASSENER
HONG KONG — Developing nations in Asia, it seems, are finally seeing the light.
A blog about energy and the environment.
Go to Blog
In May, the Asian Development Bank started a major drive to promote solar power across the region. Last year, the Indian government approved an ambitious National Solar Mission, which seeks a huge increase in the country’s solar-energy capabilities. Bangladesh , with the support of the World Bank , is aiming to have one million remote rural homes supplied with solar panels by the end of 2012.
And in India , where nearly 40 percent of households have no access to electricity, companies like Selco Solar and Orb Energy have helped tens of thousands of families and small entrepreneurs purchase solar panels.
All worthy causes. So worthy and sensible, in fact, that you may well ask why on earth they did not take off much earlier.
The answer, as is so often the case, is political support — or, until relatively recently, the lack of it — and, inevitably, cost.
“The upfront costs of installing solar-electricity-generating farms, plus high borrowing costs and the fact that developing nations struggle to access long-term capital, have inhibited the growth of solar energy until recently,” said Seethapathy Chander, chairman of the committee on energy issues at the Asian Development Bank in Manila.
“It takes a long time before investment costs are recouped, and you need long-term financing until that stage is reached.”
That also applies to small, single-household roof panels that provide enough electricity for a few extra hours of lighting, which can make a huge difference — adding study time for children and extra hours for making and selling goods.
Rooftop solar energy can replace kerosene, which generates smoke and poor-quality light and eats heavily into the scarce resources of the poor.
“A street vendor in India might make 800 rupees a month — that’s about $16,” said Harish Hande, founder of Selco Solar in Bangalore. “But he might have to spend as much as 210 rupees of that on kerosene or candles.”
By contrast, the modest electricity produced by rooftop panels is effectively free, recouping the initial investment after a few years. But even a 15 percent down payment on a loan for a small solar home lighting system — which typically costs 8,500 to 11,000 rupees — is beyond the reach of many families, Mr. Hande said.
In developing nations like Sri Lanka or India, said Damian Miller, an American-British citizen who set up Orb Energy in 2006, the cost of a panel can be 20 percent of the annual income of a poor off-grid household.
In terms of the scale of the investment, he said, “it’s similar to a Western household buying a car.”
Banks were long reluctant to lend to the poor. Increasingly, however, companies like Selco and Orb Energy have been able to convince some local banks that low-income earners are creditworthy and that solar-related credits bring in solid business in much the same way that car financing does.
“The trick to making it work commercially is to make it affordable: To allow for bite-size financing that the poor can pay for, on a monthly basis, rather than in large chunks,” said Mr. Miller.
On the large-scale level — big solar farms that feed the overall electricity grid — activity also is picking up.
“Many parts of Asia have three or four times the amount of sun that Germany gets,” said Mr. Chander of the Asian Development Bank. “It makes a lot of sense to deploy solar-based electricity generation facilities here.”
At the same time, governments have become more willing to promote alternative energies and, because of falling costs, more able to do so.
Over the years, technological advances have made panels cheaper and more efficient, while the global financial crisis created a glut of panels as many projects in Western countries stalled. China has become a major manufacturer and exporter of solar energy equipment, though it has yet to generate solar power on a large scale.
Cheaper panels, combined with lower interest rates since the financial crisis, have helped put solar energy systems within the financial reach of poorer nations, said Anil Cabraal, an alternative energy expert who, until his retirement from the World Bank in April, got many of the bank’s solar projects in Asia and Africa under way over the past decade.
Under the solar initiative it announced this year, the Asian Development Bank hopes to help put in place solar power projects with a total capacity of 3,000 megawatts by 2013.
The total operating capacity now is less than 500 megawatts. (One megawatt is enough to cover the power demand of about 200 homes, or 1,000 people, in developing Asia.)
The solar mission in India aims to have 20,000 megawatts of grid-connected solar energy by 2022, up from only about 2 megawatts now.
It also wants to help increase off-grid solar energy, currently at about 20 megawatts a year, to 10 times that amount by 2013, and to 2,000 megawatts by 2022.
The government has committed $20 billion to the program and is hoping it will attract additional investments from the private and financial sectors, said Gauri Singh, a senior official at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in New Delhi.
Vast as those numbers are, the combined target will still make up only a tiny fraction of the overall energy mix in India, Ms. Singh acknowledged. What is more important, she said, was that the initiative will help utility operators and manufacturers expand their knowledge of solar technology.
Of course, solar energy will never be able to wean the world fully from its reliance on fossil fuels. Right now, solar energy accounts for less than a quarter of a percent of overall energy demand in Asia, and only 1 percent or 2 percent in the United States, according to Mr. Chander at the Asian Development Bank.
Once the various solar initiatives start operating in Asia, however, solar energy could contribute 3 percent to 5 percent in the region, he said.
That may not seem like a lot — but it will make a big difference to a lot of people.

Yunnan Province in Three Dimensions
In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player here .
These aren’t your childhood pop-up books.
In June, we invited the photographer and artist Colette Fu to  help Zach Wise, a multimedia producer, create   360-degree  portraits of her project, “ We Are Tiger Dragon People .”
The pop-up project was Ms. Fu’s effort to  photograph the 25 ethnic minorities of China’s Yunnan Province , where her mother was born and where she developed an interest in photography while teaching English in the mid-1990s. She spent 2008 traveling the region on a Fulbright scholarship.
Growing up in New Jersey, Ms. Fu liked making things with her hands. So when she found herself tiring of photography, it made sense to add a third dimension to her work.
“My dad always wanted me to be an engineer,” said Ms. Fu, who has  lived in Philadelphia on and off since 2004, at one point squatting in a warehouse. “Now, ironically, I’m a paper engineer.”
She earned her master of fine arts degree in photography at the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2003. But there was no school for pop-up photography. Learning the craft was a do-it-yourself process. Ms. Fu tackled it during an artist’s residency at the Alden B. Dow Center for Creativity in Michigan, where she deconstructed pop-up books she had bought on eBay.
Movable books — an umbrella term that includes pop-up books — have been around for hundreds of years, according to Ann Montanaro, a former Rutgers University librarian and director of the Movable Book Society . Until 20th-century England, many  were used to illustrate the structure of the human body and the location of the planets, among other — mostly scientific — things. (Ms. Fu has also done projects with a scientific bent, exploring concepts like anxiety in pop-up form.)
The photographer Bruce  Foster created a pop-up book on sports photography, but Ms. Montanaro said Ms. Fu is the only artist she has heard of using photography so realistically in pop-up format.
“Other than publishers who have used inexpensive photographs to do children’s books,” she said, “I really am not aware of anybody who has done anything  like what Colette is doing.”
There are, of course, photographic challenges associated with pop-up design. Ms. Fu must take pictures face-on, ensuring that she captures full-body views. She shoots flat to avoid shadows. And she takes as many photographs as she can, focusing on anything that could work well in three dimensions. Rarely does she plan her pop-up work in advance. Much of the creative challenge is making sense of the collection of images that results from her travels.
Movable books tend to appeal to a broad range of viewers, Ms. Fu said, meaning they can be used as tools for education. Part of her goal is to encourage curiosity in Yunnan Province.
“Everybody likes to look at them,” she said of the books. “Whatever the content is, they’re more likely to inquire about it.”

The three photographs in the interactive graphic show:
1. The Axi Fire Festival. The Axi, one of the 27 branches of the Yi people, has the festival to honor Mu Deng, the man who brought them fire.
2. A Dulong Woman. Only about 4,600 Dulong people live near the Dulong River in northwest Yunnan, along the borders of Tibet and Burma. Dulong women believe that their tattoos resemble butterflies, because the souls of the dead were said to turn into butterflies. As of 2009, only 40 tattooed Dulong women were left in the region.
3. Dai Food. The largest number of Dai people live in Xishuangbanna, a lush, subtropical land where the soil is very fertile. Their food is similar to Thai food in that it combines sour, spicy, salty and sweet flavors.

Afghanistan: Aftermaths

A former Afghan National Army soldier sits at an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Physical Rehabilitation Center in Kabul , where he receives physiotherapy and prosthetic treatment, on June 12, 2010. Doctors amputated both his legs above the knees after he was wounded by a roadside bomb.
KANDAHAR — We often read about acts of war and engage with the drama of immediate events. But our attention moves on, and lost to our perceptions of war are the daily struggles and successes of people whose lives continue beyond the tragedy.
This series of portraits explores the aftermath of war: a boy with shrapnel wounds in his cheek from a suicide bombing, a fruit seller made paraplegic by a bullet fired from an American convoy, a farmer who caught the wrath of a Taliban bomb intended for soldiers.
As Afghanistan’s most recent war winds on into its 10th year, such stories multiply. And the Afghans who got too close carry on.

Wahida, a 40-year-old mother of six, stands for a portrait at her brother’s house in Afghanistan on June 7, 2010. She, her husband and one of her sons were traveling in a vehicle near a military convoy on Jalalabad Road in Kabul in 2004 when the convoy was attacked with a roadside bomb.
“I heard a big explosion, and then I don’t remember anything,” she recalled. “I woke up and I had lost my arms, my husband, and my son had lost an eye”. Wahida is now a double amputee above the elbows and has severe facial scarring from the explosion. She lives in a tent at her brother’s house and is supported by an allowance from the International Committee of the Red Cross.

An Afghan man, wounded in what his family claims was a NATO airstrike, lies in Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan, June 25, 2010. Mirwais Hospital provides treatment to Afghans from Kandahar Province, as well as the surrounding provinces of Zabul, Oruzgan, Helmand and Nimruz. Mirwais is supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, although if patients can afford it, they go to Pakistan to receive medical treatment at private hospitals with better facilities.

Drones as Occupational Hazard
By STEPHEN FARRELL
The C.I.A. is intensifying its campaign of using drones to bomb the mountains in western Pakistan, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. Stephen Farrell, a Times correspondent and blogger for At War, recalls his experience with drones flying overhead when he was kidnapped by the Taliban on the Afghan side of the border a year ago.
Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press A U.S. drone flies over the moon above Kandahar Air Field, southern Afghanistan.
“Tony Blair, George Bush,” grinned the shovel-bearded Taliban commander, pointing up to the sky from which a drone was clearly audible, right above our heads.
Shovel Beard could hear it. His men could hear it. I could hear it. But still the Taliban continued to sit in the open air, clearly visible to the electronic eyes above.
It was September 2009 and my Afghan colleague Sultan Munadi and I were being held captive by this group of Taliban near Kunduz in northern
Afghanistan.
For an entire day they sat out in the open, chatting about the Chinese motorcycles propped against the farmyard wall, fiddling with their Nokia and Motorola cellphones, aware, but apparently unconcerned, about the eavesdroppers thousands of feet above us.
They even carried out weapons drills in the open air. During one session, Shovel Beard held up his heavy, tripod-mounted machine gun with a single hand and pointed it toward the sky, boasting that he had used it to shoot down helicopters
It seemed unlikely that he would have been able to hit the right cloud, never mind a fast-moving dot, but no one was going to argue, captive or underling. He spent half an hour inviting the younger Taliban to imitate him, and showed evident delight when none was able to lift it above the shoulder, as he could. They tried again and again, and all failed.
All this in the noon daylight, pointing his barrel straight into the electronic eyes of the drones that were plainly audible, but invisible, above.
Of course the Taliban’s insouciance might have derived, in part, from the fact that it was by no means the first time in Afghan history that foreign powers had sought to crush Afghans with air power.
The fathers and uncles of these Taliban, indeed, possibly Shovel Beard himself because he seemed old enough, had fought rocket-armed Soviet helicopter gunships, as contemporary New York Times accounts record.
And the Afghans of their great-grandfathers’ generation would have looked up into the skies in 1919 to see bombs falling from British warplanes of World War I vintage.
But right here, right now the Taliban’s failure to take even the most basic precautions was beyond careless. It was the opposite of furtive. And these men, whatever their shortcomings, knew how to do furtive.
So what was behind their near-suicidal behavior? Even allowing for the fact that village Taliban are hardly the highest-educated warriors in
the world?
Over the days, clues to their thinking began to emerge.
From their behavior, their movements around the countryside and their readiness even to dine together by the dozen in the open air, they appeared to have come to the conclusion that there was very little that they could do about the drones. Their enemy had an overpowering aerial superiority. It was a fact in the sky. The choice before them was to worry, or to accept it as an occupational hazard. They chose the latter.
Secondly, they had an entirely different perspective. To us the drone was a hugely significant presence. While the Taliban clearly controlled the countryside around — we had driven around for days, and there was not a single NATO or Afghan government soldier in sight — the drone was the one sign of wider military realities outside this small pocket of Taliban hegemony.
But to them it appeared to be a minor irritant compared with what they had gone through in the past. One young farmer/Taliban said that they had all spent years as fugitives in and around these farmlands during the years when government forces controlled the area. The government knew who was Taliban, so these men spent 24 hours a day hiding from Afghan National Army and NATO forces, skulking indoors, away from the human and electronic eyes of drones, helicopters and government spies.
However, now they were no longer the hunted amid these rice fields and orchards, indeed they were the hunter. They could go almost anywhere, do almost anything. The drones were one of the only serpents left in their garden, and that was a reduced threat that they felt they could live with.
“You think this is difficult for us, you think this is hardship,” said one, after the third or fourth change of location within 24 hours. “Only two or three years ago we had to spend weeks and months locked inside buildings in the dark. Now it is much easier for us to move around and assemble than it used to be. This is nothing for us.”
Some of this account was probably bluster. But some of it seemed plausible, or at least consistent with realities on the ground in the area over recent years.
But there was also a psychological factor, one common among militant groups in the Middle East. While the Taliban will take the best weapons they can from whichever outside agency wants to supply or sell them, they also seek to portray themselves as the underdog against the mighty West.
It is a refrain you heard constantly from these men, as from militants in Iraq, Gaza and the West Bank. Faced with an enemy who can wield overwhelming power they seek to invert it, to redefine military weakness as moral superiority, and survival as victory.
The enemy may have their F16s, their MRAPs, Humvees or Merkavas, they argue, but without these shiny foreign toys they are nothing. Just wait until the American empire is gone and we are fighting on a level playing field. Maybe in 20 years, 100 years, 200 years. We can wait. Can they?
As long-term strategies go, Afghanistan’s history has much that can be cited in support of it. But forces of history for the next millennium are one thing. Force protection for the next week is another.
Within days most of these men were likely dead, killed by NATO forces who tracked their movements through the very drones about which they were so careless.
So, too, was my Afghan colleague, Sultan, and Corporal John Harrison, one of the British soldiers who carried out the raid. Civilians also.
Probably not Shovel Beard. He had disappeared 24 hours earlier.

An Education Fund for Sultan Munadi's Children
The colleagues and friends of Sultan Munadi, who was slain during a rescue operation in Afghanistan, would like to thank readers for the many generous donations they made to help his family. Sultan’s family is extraordinarily grateful to them as well.
Sultan’s family currently has the funds they need to cover their basic living costs. As a result, Sultan’s friends and colleagues have decided to use the reader donations to create a fund to educate his children. Sultan passionately believed that education was the key to stabilizing Afghanistan. His friends and colleagues believe that educating Sultan’s children is the best way to honor his memory. Our goal is to raise enough funds to allow his children to receive the best education possible.
The education fund will include the donations readers have made since Sultan was killed in September 2009 and new contributions from Sultan’s friends and colleagues at The New York Times. If readers would like to contribute to the education fund, details are below. We thank readers again for the donations they have already made.

189;"Three Faces of the New China
Susan Walsh/Associated Press
UNITED NATIONS — In a blur of headlines over the past few days,  Americans have been surprised with  brief, seemingly contradictory glimpses of how China is wielding  its newfound power.
Related
Kyodo/Reuters
POWER PLAY Japan was forced to rescind the arrest of a trawler captain.
There was China the neighborhood bully, cutting off Japan’s access to rare-earth minerals unless Tokyo folded in a minor, but longstanding, territorial dispute. (The Japanese folded.)
There was China the schmoozer, with its prime minister, Wen Jiabao , trying his hardest on Thursday to deflect President Obama ’s pressure over the value of China’s currency — really a battle over whether jobs go to workers in Seattle or Shenzhen. The two leaders talked for two hours at the United Nations .  The outcome was left unclear.
And there was China the classic realist, opting for convenient inconsistency on sanctions against North Korea and Iran in efforts to balance its competing national interests.  (The first is to engage the West on the Security Council. The others include  securing oil and protecting a client-state from collapse.)
In one sense, there’s nothing surprising about a rising power finding subtle ways to handle complex problems. But before China’s breakout  from poverty to arguably the world’s No. 2 economy, its default position on foreign policy was to restate the principle of non-interference in other nations’ affairs and focus largely on its neighborhood.
That was before it had the military resources and the incentive to start thinking of how to secure and defend interests around the globe. Today, its interests include access to oil in places like Sudan and Iran, safe shipping around the Horn of Africa,  the ability to manipulate its currency for its own gain.
And for the first time, the world is seeing a distinct range of behaviors, from aggressive to passive-aggressive to diplomatic, in places that 20 years ago China’s leaders rarely thought about.
What American diplomats and analysts now have to figure out is what drives China’s actions and responses, how to try to shape them and, some would argue, what limits to try to set.
“The China that President Obama hoped he was getting a year ago, the one that becomes this great cooperative global power on the biggest issues of the day — that’s not the China he’s dealing with today,” said David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George Washington University .
A senior administration official who often deals with the Chinese leadership said: “As they begin to manage their many constituencies, their politics is looking more like ours.”
Here’s a scouting report so far on China’s style of muscle-flexing:
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: TIME FOR THE BIG STICK
For decades countries around Asia have been wary of China’s resurgence — tracking how many ships and missiles it was acquiring, and how it was using its influence as an investor. A decade ago, as President Bush took power, a number of neoconservatives urged him to “contain” China’s presumed ambitions.
But containment would have probably been impossible and it proved, at least in the past decade, unnecessary. So far Beijing has not pressed new territorial claims; it has simply begun to defend old ones in sparsely inhabited places.
The Japanese stepped into one of those when they arrested the captain of a Chinese trawler near a group of islands in the East China Sea, called the Senkaku by the Japanese and the Diaoyu by China. The Japanese said the trawler rammed a Japanese coast guard vessel. A few years ago this might have been sorted out quietly  as a consular issue. Not this time.
The Chinese — perhaps driven by the People’s Liberation Army, perhaps eager to begin to declare their equivalent of the Monroe Doctrine — demanded the captain’s return. Japan refused. Pushed by a nationalistic groundswell, China started blocking shipments of the rare earths, an act that threatened Japan’s electronics industry.
“This played to the Asia First crowd in China,” said Mr. Shambaugh, referring to a faction in China’s establishment that says the wise course is to dominate the region while avoiding tussles with great powers. In recent months there have been disputes over American exercises in nearby waters and over the border with India.
“We’ve begun pushing back,” said a senior administration official, explaining why the United States is sending an aircraft carrier to the area.
But the Japanese, after 20 years of recession ,  had no push left in them. The prosecutor dropped charges on Friday.
WASHINGTON: THE ART OF DEFLECTION
If China’s strategy with Asia is all sharp elbows, with the United States it is largely politeness and deflection — most of the time.

Indian Judges Rule on a Matter of Faith
By ROBERT MACKEY
Douglas E. Curran/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In 1992, Hindu fundamentalists broke through barricades and destroyed a 16th-century mosque at a disputed holy site in the Indian city of Ayodhya.
Updated | 3:24 p.m. As my colleague Jim Yardley reports , a three-judge panel in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh ruled Thursday that a plot of land in Ayodhya where a mosque was destroyed by Hindu fundamentalists in 1992 , sparking violence that left nearly 2,000 people dead, should be divided between Muslims and Hindus.
So far, there have been no reports of violence in response to the court’s complex decision, which lawyers representing both Muslim and Hindu groups said they would ask India’s Supreme Court to review. Documents containing what the court calls “the gist” of the three judges’ rulings were posted online (and are embedded at the end of this post).
Before the verdict was issued, Sopan Joshi wrote in the Indian newsweekly Tehelka, “There is always agitation when a matter of faith is tested on scales of science and history.”
Since they do make factual assertions about beliefs and faith traditions, the rulings of the three judges make for remarkable reading. One judge, Dharam Veer Sharma, for instance, ruled, “The disputed site is the birth place of Lord Ram,” and then added this, about the presence of the deity’s spirit at the site:
Spirit of divine ever remains present everywhere at all times for anyone to invoke at any shape or form in accordance with his own aspirations, and it can be shapeless and formless also.
A video report of the ruling from Al Jazeera includes footage of the attack on the mosque in 1992.
In his article for  Tehelka, Mr. Joshi anticipated the absence of violence in response to the verdict, since, he wrote, both the national and local governments “want to maintain law and order to the point of an obsession.”
He added, “The administrative effort to that end is unprecedented. Anybody who has seen a riot at close quarters knows riots cannot happen when the government is committed to not letting them happen.”
As Mr. Joshi explained, the judges were asked to “tackle about 100 major and minor issues in the four suits that comprise the case,” delving into arcane issues of history, religion and archaeology. Among other things, the court was asked to consider whether the destroyed mosque, built in the 16th century by India’s first Mughal ruler, was, in fact, constructed on the site of the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram, from stones of an older Hindu temple.
The evidence presented to the judges included the results of excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India in 2003, which, Mr. Joshi noted, “found remains of structures with features indicating the existence of a north Indian Hindu temple underneath where the Babri Masjid stood. The question is: was it a temple of Ram? This is open to interpretation. Then, the court has been asked to rule on whether this temple was demolished to build the mosque.”
Also introduced into evidence were the observations of Joseph Tieffenthaler, an Austrian Jesuit, who arrived in India in 1740. The missionary recorded local accounts that held that two centuries earlier, in 1528, Babur, India’s Muslim emperor, had ordered the destruction of the house where Ram was said to have been born to “deprive the Gentiles of the opportunity to practice their superstitions.”
Here are the three summaries of the judge’s rulings in the case, posted on Scribd by India’s NDTV :

When I used to ask my mother about her family village in China, she always said it was three hours from Canton by bus. A hundred years ago, when my great-grandfather left China for good, that couldn’t have been far, but it was certainly no help in locating it. So I was pleased — though still mystified — to read in Deborah Fallows’s charming and witty little book that in China, “if you ask someone where their hometown is, they’ll say it is seven hours by bus. Or four hours by train. They won’t tell you where it is.”
DREAMING IN CHINESE
Mandarin Lessons in Life, Love, and Language
By Deborah Fallows
Illustrated. 205 pp. Walker & Company. $22
Fallows spent three years living in China with her husband, the journalist James Fallows . Since she’s a linguist by training, her method of getting under the skin of the country was to immerse herself in its language. In “Dreaming in Chinese,” she uses key phrases and concepts to unlock aspects of the society that interested or surprised her, casting light along the way on many idiosyncrasies of the Chinese view of the world.
Fallows doesn’t arrive with many preconceptions. Instead, she takes the Chinese as they see and present themselves. And she soon discovers that what the Chinese think is important isn’t always what we think is important. One thing they’re interested in is ensuring good luck. This explains why the Beijing Olympics began on Aug. 8, 2008, at 8:08 p.m. Eight, ba, rhymes with fa, “as in fa cai, which means ‘to become wealthy,’ ” making it a very auspicious number. And even though Aug. 8 was well into the rainy season, it didn’t rain.
Auspiciousness also enters into the choosing of names, an art in itself. Most Chinese have three names: surname (there are just 100 common surnames in a population of 1.3 billion people), middle name (to identify your generation and connect you with your cousins) and personal name. Which yields the realization that — in a country where most people are allowed only one child — future generations will have no cousins.
On matters that Westerners make a fuss about, like human rights, Fallows presents the common Chinese viewpoint. At a conference on censorship, technology and commerce, she recalls that “one exasperated Chinese participant finally blurted out that people, the laobaixing, aren’t as preoccupied as Westerners about free speech and an uncensored Internet: what laobaixing really want, he said, is . . . a flush toilet, a refrigerator and a color TV.” For ordinary Chinese, material concerns come first.
Fallows has an endearing affection for these laobaixing, these common folk. Unlike conventional journalists, she’s not very interested in press conferences, in listening to what the politicians say. Little by little, she finds herself becoming more like the laobaixing: learning to deal with the plethora of rules as the Chinese do — by finding ways around them.
“Dreaming in Chinese” is chatty and colloquial, with helpful photographs and drawings, as well as a pronunciation guide. The eager student will learn a fair bit about the history of the language and how its array of characters and tones were systematized, all the while gathering insights into the country’s customs and culture. Rather than draw sweeping conclusions, Fallows sticks to her own experiences and observations, which makes her book all the more valuable. China hands will have many moments of recognition. For others, “Dreaming in Chinese” will be a fascinating introduction to a foreign culture.
Lesley Downer is the author of “On the Narrow Road to the Deep North” and other nonfiction books on Asia. Her most recent book is a novel, “The Courtesan and the Samurai.”

194;"Chinese Writers Give a Warmer Take on U.S. Democracy
By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW
Reprints
Shortly after Steven Shen’s parents joined him in Los Angeles in 2005, his mother, emboldened by an international dialing plan costing just $24.99 a month, began making long telephone calls to relatives and friends back in Beijing. One day Mr. Shen asked: What did they talk about?
“The main thing I tell them about is always the same, how embarrassed I am about having criticized capitalism all my life, and here I am now, retired and appreciating it,” said the former high school teacher. She talked about receiving a free pair of eyeglasses for her failing vision; her husband, a retired professor of Chinese, got a hearing aid, courtesy of what the family considers a generous welfare system for the elderly in the United States.
“My parents worked all their lives for China , and no one ever thought to take care of their eyes or ears,” Mr. Shen, 50, said in an interview.
Mr. Shen’s book about his 21 years in the United States, called “America Is Also Ridiculous,” went on sale  in Shanghai on Tuesday before an enthusiastic crowd of  students and scholars at Fudan University. Prepublication reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, with endorsements from celebrities like the actor and film director Jiang Wen and the cult novelist Wang Shuo.
Yet despite the seemingly critical title, Mr. Shen’s book is no nationalist tract like “China Is Unhappy,” a 2009 book by five authors who accused the West of trying to keep China down. That book’s initial print run of 180,000 sold out quickly, feeding off a potent mixture of dislike and envy that characterizes anti-Americanism in a country where, for decades, people campaigned against the evils of Western imperialism.
“America Is Also Ridiculous ” is actually a paean to a country Mr. Shen loves and admires.
So why the provocative title? He grinned at the question.
“There are many things about America that strike our traditional mind-set, me too, as ridiculous,” he said. “For example, sentencing a criminal to 180 years in jail. If he’s that bad, why not just shoot him? Who’s going to pay to keep him in jail?” Many Chinese also disapprove of U.S. gun laws. “They say people own 300 million guns there. To us, this is just crazy.”
As China moves into its fourth decade of fast-paced economic reform, much is changing here. “China is getting more and more integrated with the outside world. People are getting more critical. I would say their understanding of America is getting more and more real,” said Mr. Shen.
A kind of subtle confluence is taking shape. Americans, confidence badly shaken, fret about China’s seemingly unstoppable economic growth and wonder when their country will be challenged as the global superpower. Here in China, something else is happening: deeper understanding of democracy is producing greater admiration, in some quarters.
The reason is simple, Mr. Shen said. “There is no perfect system. But if you have to choose between democracy and dictatorship, you must choose democracy, even with its many defects. Here we just don’t have the system to build up a modern civilization.”
Over all, however, China’s attitude toward America is still polarized.
“When we talk about the United States here in China, there have always been two extremes,” Mr. Shen said. “One side is completely anti-American, and the other is completely pro-American. These two sides have existed for a very long time and to get rid of them, well, there’s a long way to go. I don’t see any shortcuts to it.”
Mr. Shen’s book is partly a story of personal transformation. A radio journalist, he rejected the security of a state job for New York in 1989, working his way up from restaurant jobs to his present position as film entrepreneur and chairman of the China-U.S. Business Summit, based in Los Angeles.
Mr. Shen’s is one of several recent Chinese books to capture this new phenomenon of what might be called critical admiration for America.
“Details of Democracy” is another, a collection of columns by Liu Yu about politics and daily life in the United States, drawing on the years she spent there between 2000 and 2007. She is now a politics lecturer at the University of Cambridge , in England. Her book is intellectual as well as lively, referencing writers like Alexis de Tocqueville. It hasn’t hurt sales.
In fact, the book is a hit. Published in June 2009, it has sold nearly 120,000 copies and is in its 17th print run, according to Shanghai Sanlian Shudian Press.
Using vivid, personal details, Ms. Liu writes about a range of topics: disabled people in the United States winning fair treatment; how the legal system, though prone to excesses, regularly delivers justice; domestic opposition to the war in Iraq. She compares the individual stories to similar ones in China, where the outcomes are usually far worse, with civil society struggling for recognition, the legal system weak and criticism of leaders or policies banned.
As Mr. Shen and Ms. Liu know, all of this closely relates to global politics and shifting power relations in this century, because cultural values guide what we do, even in the economy.
Speaking in Geneva last month, Henry A. Kissinger warned that the United States and China risked confrontation unless they created “a pattern of continuous cooperation.” At the same International Institute for Strategic Studies event, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, James B. Steinberg , called on the two countries to build a relationship based on “strategic trust,” similar to the culturally based trust between Europe and the United States.
Experts are skeptical. “I don’t see it developing, simply because the U.S. and China do not share fundamental values in common, either domestically or internationally,” said David Shambaugh, a politics professor at George Washington University .
In her afterword, Ms. Liu writes, “For so many years, we spent so long judging the pros and cons of the ‘Western system,’ but we didn’t take the time to go and see what it really was.”
By giving people a realistic picture of democracy that shows its merits to be greater than its flaws, she and Mr. Shen are contributing to the shared cultural trust policy makers hope to see.

199;"China
Amid the media hoopla, however, some of China's super rich have stepped forward voluntarily.
Chen Guangbiao, a self-made millionaire and one of the few confirmed guests at the dinner, told Gates and Buffett that he would donate his entire fortune, an estimated $735 million, to charity upon his death, jokingly calling his decision a ""nice-to-meet-you"" gift for the Americans.
""I don't want to become a slave to my wealth,"" he told CNN before the event.
Chen, 42, whose parents were poor farmers, now runs a booming renewable resources and recycling business in eastern Jiangsu province. He said he donated most of the $60 million profit his company made in 2009.
""Every dollar I made was with the help of others -- so I want to give it back to society and make my life more meaningful and valuable,"" he said.
China now boasts at least 189 billionaires (in U.S. dollars), second only to the United States, according to a just-released list by Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based publishing group that specializes in surveying the country's super rich.
Wealthy Chinese seem unwilling to open their purse strings for charitable causes, however.
In 2009, a government-sponsored honor roll listed 121 Chinese philanthropists who donated a combined $277 million, less than half of what a single American family -- financier Stanley Druckenmiller and his wife -- gave away in the same year in the United States.
Many Chinese tycoons prefer to keep a low profile. Some worry about their safety and that of their children, while others fear unwanted scrutiny from corrupt local officials.
Yet others blame the lack of a legal framework or favorable taxation policies for their reluctance to publicly pledge donations as Chen did.
""I'd rather focus on charity work through my company's own foundation, by setting up education projects in poor provinces and encouraging employees to volunteer their time and effort,"" Zhang Xin, another confirmed guest at the dinner, told CNN.
Zhang, 45, one of China's biggest property developers, sits on top of family holdings estimated to be worth more than $2 billion.
Despite the philosophical difference, Zhang tweeted that she and many other tycoons at the dinner professed their deep respect and admiration for Gates and Buffett as businessmen and philanthropists, lining up for photos and autographs.
Gates and Buffett say while they understand the concerns, they encourage their Chinese guests to take a great leap forward with long-term impact on their communities.
""We hope that people who would join and put their names forth will have a good effect on people 50 years from now -- and I think it will,"" Buffett said.
No matter the method, analysts say, the timing is good for Chinese tycoons to put their wealth back into society. The government recently revealed that China's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, had been above the 0.4 benchmark since 2000, an alarming position shared by only a few other African and Latin American countries.
It may take some time, though, to see the concept of philanthropy take roots in the minds of China's super rich, since most of them have accumulated their fortunes only recently following the country's economic reforms.
The average age of someone on China's super rich lists is 51, about 15 years younger than their Western counterparts, says Rupert Hoogewerf, chief researcher at Hurun Report.
""Chinese entrepreneurs have made their money very quickly and they haven't really had time to think about how to spend it -- they are still in wealth-creation modes,"" he said.
Gates and Buffett acknowledge the challenge, but remain optimistic.
""Philanthropy is new, along with the new wealth here in China,"" Gates said. ""So philanthropists meeting with each other -- and sharing ideas -- moves you up the learning curve a lot faster than if you are doing it in isolation.""
Citing privacy concerns, Gates and Buffett declined to name any of the participants at the dinner. State media reported guests were a who's who list in China's business world, along with high-ranking government officials -- including the minister of civil affairs, who is in charge of all charity work in the country.
Gates did let on one name: action movie star Jet Li, praising his effort in raising public awareness on the importance of philanthropy.
The public has taken notice.
Wang Yifei, a 28-year-old graphic designer struggling to set up his own business, hosted a ""rival"" dinner to discuss philanthropy at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in Beijing on the same night, packing more than 100 participants into a 56-seat venue.
""Those billionaires don't really know what we common people want,"" he told CNN, explaining his reason for throwing the $6 per head buffet dinner event.
""The potential of what ordinary people can do in philanthropy is huge,"" he added. ""Most donations in the United States come from ordinary people and I think we can achieve the same in China if we can set up a good platform.""
Even all the controversies surrounding the Gates-Buffett dinner may have been a blessing in disguise, analysts say, prompting a healthy debate on a topic largely ignored by the public before and marking a watershed for philanthropy in China
""Gates and Buffett are the two biggest authorities on the subject. By coming to China to talk about it, they have sown the seeds in very fertile ground,"" Hoogewerf said.

200;"United Nations
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Opium production has dropped significantly in Afghanistan, in large part because of a plant infection in the country's war-torn south, a U.N. report said on Thursday.
""This is good news but there is no room for false optimism; the market may again become lucrative for poppy-crop growers so we have to monitor the situation closely,"" said Yury Fedotov, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.
The development was detailed in the office's 2010 Afghan Opium Survey. Insurgents in Afghanistan have financed their operations through the opium trade.
The report said the total 2010 production was estimated at 3,600 metric tons, down 48 percent from 2009.
""The decrease was largely due to a plant infection hitting the major poppy-crop growing provinces of Helmand and Kandahar particularly hard,"" the report said.
""Plant diseases are a normal occurrence all over the world. In Afghanistan, which produces 92 per cent of the world's opium, they can affect the poppy crop. The current strain attacks the roots of the plant, climbing up the stem and causing the opium capsule to wither away. These signs are similar to those observed in previous such outbreaks in the region,"" the report said.
Prices of opium are rising after a decline from 2005, the report said.
""In the short run, the decline in opium production has pushed prices up. Despite the drop in overall production, the farm-gate income of opium farmers rose markedly. Now that opium is commanding high prices again, the gross income for farmers per hectare has increased by 36 per cent to $4,900.
The report said opium cultivation remained stable with 98 percent of cultivation taking place in nine provinces in the south and west of the country.

201;"The South also demanded that North Korea ""immediately stop its military threats and aggressive behaviors at sea borders,"" the statement said.
The two sides did not set a date for the next round of talks, Yonhap reported.
At the start of Thursday's talks, North Korea's lead negotiator called for a ""humanitarian view"" in dealing with issues proposed by the two Koreas, Yonhap said, referring to a pooled newsgathering report.
""All issues should be resolved from the point of a humanitarian view at today's talks,"" North lead negotiator Col. Ri Shin-kwon was quoted as saying in the pooled report.
The South Korean lead negotiator sounded a cautious note.
""We will watch how your side deals with those issues,"" said Col. Moon Sang-kyun, according to the pooled report.
Pyongyang had asked to discuss the two countries' de facto sea border on the west coast. North Korea wants the border, known as the Northern Limit Line, redrawn farther south.
Deadly naval clashes between North and South took place along the Northern Limit Line in 1999, 2002 and 2009.
North Korea also wanted to discuss a South Korean plan to fly anti-Pyongyang leaflets into the North, in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship in March. South Korea has since deferred the leaflet plan.
The communist North's proposal was met with skepticism. Military officials in South Korea say the North tends to act provocatively, then follow with proposals to talk and try to win concessions, Yonhap said.
The two Koreas are technically still at war, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty. North-South relations remain tense.
In recent weeks, Pyongyang also has proposed temporarily reuniting Korean families separated by war.
The Korean War divided millions of families. About 10,000 people applied to take part in a similar reunion last year, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate.

202;"Sarath Fonseka
Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sarath Fonseka, Sri Lanka's former armed forces chief, was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for ""disgraceful conduct"" in military procurements Thursday, officials said.
Fonseka, who led troops to defeat Tamil Tiger rebels last year, was to be moved from the Navy headquarters, where he was detained, to the Welikade Prison in Colombo.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who returned to Colombo after attending the United Nations sessions in New York, issued a proclamation upholding the findings by a court martial that Fonseka was guilty on four counts of violating military procurement procedures.
The court martial said Fonseka had ""committed a fraudulent act"" by not disclosing that his son-in-law Danuna Tillekeratne ""had an interest or concern"" in a local company that supplied the army with day vision binoculars, maintenance free batteries, power generators and very high frequency direction finders.
In August, the court martial had recommended that Fonseka, be stripped of all his ranks, titles, decorations and medals. His monthly pension was also withdrawn.
Fonseka must still go to civil courts that are hearing at least three more cases against him.
One involves statements printed in a local Sunday newspaper where he allegedly said that the Army was ordered to shoot civilians who surrendered with white flags during the separatist war that ended in In May 2009. Fonseka, however, has denied making the statement. If found guilty, he may face life imprisonment over the charges.
Another case relates to allegations that he employed Army deserters.
The verdict has sealed a major fall from grace for Fonseka who once was called the ""best Army commander in the world,"" by Sri Lanka's president.

203;"China
New York (CNNMoney.com) -- China on Thursday urged the United States to resist protectionism and avoid damaging both nations' economies, following the U.S. House's passage of legislation designed to combat Beijing's manipulation of currency.
""We firmly oppose the U.S. Congress approving of bill. Exercising protectionism only severely damages the relationship and have negative impact on both economies and the global economies,"" said Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
""We have made our position clear to the U.S. side,"" she said, when asked whether China planned any retaliatory measures.
The House of Representatives approved the legislation on Wednesday, saying that China's moves result in unfavorable trade conditions for the United States.
The legislation, which authorizes the Commerce Department to impose duties on imports from countries with undervalued currencies, passed by a vote of 348-79.
The bill received support from both sides of the aisle, a rarity in recent sessions, with Democrats framing the legislation as a jobs issue.
""We can talk, or we can act. International trade is a high stakes, cut-throat business, and every time we simply talk, the other side acts, and every time they act, an American loses a job,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California.
China said this year it would allow its currency, the yuan, to trade in a wider range against the dollar. But the currency has scarcely appreciated since then, inflaming critics who charge that the undervalued yuan, also known as the renminbi, helps steal U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Estimates on the undervaluation of the yuan vary, depending on the economic model used, but one estimate by the Peterson Institute of International Economics puts the number at about 24 percent against the dollar.
Such undervaluing makes Chinese goods cheaper to buy in the United States and likewise drives up the price of U.S. goods sold in China.
The House vote caps years of frustration for lawmakers as the United States has continued to shed manufacturing jobs, and promises of reform from the Chinese have failed to result in policy changes.
""If this risks upsetting the People's Republic of China, so be it,"" said Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan. ""Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, a liberal or a conservative -- millions of good-paying jobs have been lost and hundreds of thousands of families across this country have suffered as a result of China's unlawful trade policies.""
The legislation now moves to the Senate. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, says the body will act quickly to move the bill to the president's desk.
""We must take decisive action against China's currency manipulation and other economically injurious behavior,"" Schumer said Tuesday, noting that the Senate will take up the issue when it reconvenes later this year.
""China is merely pretending to take significant steps on its currency,"" Schumer said. ""This sucker's game is never going to stop unless we finally call their bluff.""
But not every member of Congress is convinced, especially after China raised tariffs on U.S. poultry producers earlier this week and accused them of dumping product into the Chinese market.
Citing potential retaliatory measures from China, Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling said the bill was ""unwise public policy"" during tough economic times.
But trade groups and unions cheered the bill's passage. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka issued a statement of support and Scott Paul, the director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing echoed the message.
""This is one of the most pleasantly lopsided trade votes in recent history,"" Paul said in a statement. ""Voters are mad and Congress is finally responding.
Earlier on Wednesday, President Obama addressed the issue at a town hall-style meeting.
""The reason I'm pushing China about their currency is because their currency is undervalued,"" he said, adding that ""people generally think they are managing their currency in a way that makes our goods more expensive to sell there and their goods cheaper to sell here.""
The resulting imbalance is a major factor contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, the president said.
Last week, Obama urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to speed up the revaluation of the yuan currency, telling him in a two-hour meeting at the United Nations that the slow pace of reforms was affecting both global and U.S. economies.
The meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly followed a speech by Wen the night before, in which he told the business community in New York that China will continue reforming and opening its markets under a policy it started in 1978 by officially ending decades of isolation.
However, demands by U.S. lawmakers that China revalue its currency by more than 20 percent would bankrupt Chinese companies and lead to ""major unrest"" in his country, Wen said in the speech.

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The U.S. military says only one supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary.
Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan.
Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman,  said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open.
""We don't think it's a very serious problem,"" Dorrian said. ""it's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it.""
""We do expect these matters to be resolved.""
The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is talking with Pakistan to resolve the situation.
Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear.
Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for materiel coming into the war zone. But he emphasized it's not the only way of getting supplies in, he said. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region.
About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air.
ISAF said in a statement Thursday that its forces saw what they thought were insurgents trying to fire mortars at a coalition base in the Dand Patan District of Afghanistan's Paktiya province, near the Pakistani border.
An air weapons team targeted the suspected insurgents' firing position, located inside Afghanistan along the border area, and the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace briefly ""as they engaged this initial target,"" the ISAF statement said.
After this strike, the ""aircraft received what the crews assessed as effective small arms fire from individuals just across the border in Pakistan"" and the ISAF aircraft, operating in self-defense, entered into Pakistani airspace and killed ""several armed individuals.""
Later, Pakistani military officials told ISAF that coalition aircraft struck its border forces.
""ISAF and Pakistani forces are reviewing the operational reporting to verify the exact location of the two engagements and the facts in this case, and we will work together to fully investigate this incident.
""Both sides have in mind that it is the insurgents, operating on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan and violating the territorial sovereignty of both countries, that we are focused on fighting,"" the ISAF statement said.
ISAF issued ""sincere condolences to the Pakistani military and the families of those who were killed or injured.""
The Pakistani government said two helicopters from Afghanistan appeared to have crossed the border into Pakistan in the Mandata Kandaho, Ali Mangola area of the upper Kurram Agency and engaged an outpost of Frontier Corps through cannon fire.
The post, manned by six soldiers, is located 200 meters inside Pakistan, and troops fired their rifles to indicate that the helicopters were crossing into Pakistani territory.
Instead of heeding the warning, the choppers fired two missiles and destroyed the post, killing the three soldiers and injuring three others.
""This is the third incident of its kind during past one week. In the wake of the last incident on 27 September, contact was made at the highest military level and the incident was regretted by the USA,"" the government said.
NATO helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace from Afghanistan in pursuit of insurgents over the weekend, killing 49 people, a spokesman told CNN Monday.
Crossing the border did not violate the International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, Maj. Michael Johnson said.
Pakistan is very sensitive about U.S.-led military operations on its territory and issued a strong protest Monday.
Pakistan called the incursions ""a clear violation and breach"" of U.N. rules for foreign forces in Afghanistan.
The United Nations ""mandate terminates/finishes at the Afghanistan border. There are no agreed hot pursuit rules,"" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
A commander of international forces in the western part of Afghanistan said Thursday that Pakistan's recent ban on use of supply routes is ""not a problem"" for troops in his area of the country.
Italian Gen. Claudio Berto, talking to reporters in the Pentagon via satellite from Afghanistan, said, ""In my point of view, it's not a problem, we are really far away from Pakistan, and if you mean the goods for the soldier, they're coming through other borders, for example Turkmenistan. And we have no problem with this issue.""

206;"Indian court splits holy site into three parts
By the CNN Wire Staff
Disupted holy site to be divided
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: India remains calm after ruling on site at center of 1992 violence
Muslims have said they will appeal to the Supreme Court
Hindus will be allowed to keep an idol at the site, the court rules
The northern town has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years
New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A disputed holy site in India will be divided in an attempt to satisfy competing religious claims to the site, the Allahabad High Court ruled Thursday.
Muslims, Hindus and a local sect all will get part of the land at Ayodhya, the court said.
Muslims have already said they will appeal to the Supreme Court.
Thousands of people have died in sectarian violence in India since Hindu extremists razed a Muslim mosque on the site in 1992. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities.
They will be allowed to keep an idol in a makeshift temple under the central dome at the site, Judge S. U. Khan announced in his ruling. Khan is one of three judges on the high court.
""All three sets of parties, i.e., Muslims, Hindus and Nirmohi Akhara are declared joint title holders of the property,"" Khan wrote.

He gave them three months to come up with proposals for which sections of the property they want, while awarding some specific areas to Nirmohi Akhara, a local Hindu sect.
India beefed up security across the country as it braced for the verdict, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops in anticipation of possible violence.
The destruction of Ayodhya's Babri mosque in 1992 sparked religious riots across India, in which more than 2,000 people died. It was some of the worst violence the country has seen since independence in 1947.
But India appeared to remain calm on Thursday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged citizens not to let extremists stir up violence.
""Often it is only a few mischief makers who create divisions in our society. I would appeal to my countrymen to be vigilant and not let such people succeed in disrupting peace and harmony,"" he said in a statement after the ruling was announced.
""It is my hope that the response of the people of India to the judgement will be respectful, dignified and do our country proud,"" he said, adding that it was ""correct"" to maintain the status quo until the Supreme Court hears the case.
The Allahabad court was asked to rule on a number of issues in addition to the dispute over the ownership of the land, which has been going on for decades.
But it is not clear from their rulings if the judges were able to agree on points including whether the Hindu deity Lord Rama was actually born there and when the Babri Mosque was built.
Like India itself, they appear to have split on religious lines.
India is a majority Hindu country, but has more than 160 million Muslims. In fact, only two other countries, Indonesia and Pakistan, have more Muslims than India, although India is only about 13 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
India's government was determined to prevent sectarian violence over the Ayodhya ruling.
Paramilitary forces were deployed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Home Ministry spokesman Onkar Kedia said Thursday. In the rest of the country, paramilitary forces and air force aircraft are being kept on reserve.
About 190,000 forces are in place in Uttar Pradesh, Kedia said, without disclosing the total number of troops that have been deployed across India as a ""precautionary measure.""
India's Home Ministry also has temporarily banned bulk text messages and has urged the media to exercise restraint and to not sensationalize any possible violence.
The town of Ayodhya has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there.
The Babri Mosque was built on the site after the region became part of the Mughal Empire in the 1500s.
Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates to the site were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area.
Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace the mosque torn down by Hindu extremists.
This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after a judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid potential violence.

207;"China: 3 Japanese nationals released
By the CNN Wire Staff
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The three illegally entered a military zone, China says
They were arrested amid a diplomatic battle between Beijing and Tokyo
Another Japanese national is still being held for investigation, China says
The Japanese company that employs the four is working to confirm the release
Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Thursday released three Japanese nationals after they admitted illegally entering a Chinese military zone and expressed regret, state-run media said.
Another Japanese national, who worked with the three, remained under house arrest for illegally videotaping military targets and an investigation was continuing, the Xinhua News Agency said.
""We will continue our effort to rescue the one left behind,"" Fujita Corp., the company that employs the four Japanese nationals, said Thursday.
Fujita said it did not know the whereabouts of the three whom China had released.
All four Japanese nationals were arrested in Hebei Province on September 23 as Beijing and Tokyo clashed over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan.
The captain was taken into custody in early September off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. His arrest touched off a battle that escalated into diplomatic threats by Beijing, the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations.
Japan has since freed the fishing captain, but the two countries have continued the diplomatic battle. Both nations have demanded compensation over the captain's arrest. China says he was arrested illegally and wants damages for his damaged fishing boat. Japan said he damaged two Japanese patrol boats and has demanded compensation as well.
We will continue our effort to rescue the one left behind
--Fujita Corp
China
""We hope Japan can meet China halfway to reduce the negative impact of the incident and prevention of future incidents,"" Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said late Thursday afternoon about relations between the two countries.
China had released no further details about the four Japanese nationals, or a Chinese co-worker who went missing at the same time as the arrests. The Chinese national was presumed arrested as well.
Jiang said only that an investigation is under way.
"" I believe the relevant authorities will handle the case according to the law,"" Jiang said.
All five workers were employed by Fujita Corp., a midsize Japanese construction company. The four Japanese employees were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army, Fujita said.
Goldman Sachs Group acquired Fujita in April 2009.
Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region.
""Reiterate [that] Diaoyu Islands are inherent territory, and the incident was severe infringement of Chinese sovereignty and human rights,"" China's spokeswoman Jiang said. ""We stand by our recent statement, expounded on the Chinese government's position of territorial integrity and our willingness and goodwill to develop Japan relations.""
Japan has recently urged China to not unilaterally develop a gas field in the disputed area of the East China Sea, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
""Unilateral measures are not in accordance with this [bilateral] agreement and not conducive for the two countries,"" Deputy Press Secretary Hidenobu Sobashima said.
""We are concerned if there's a move in that direction,"" he added. ""Yes, that message has been conveyed at the ambassador level.""
Jiang said in response: ""Our position is solemn and earnest: We want no further deterioration of the relations. We hope Japan makes no new obstacles. China has complete sovereignty over the ... gas fields. China's activities there are reasonable and lawful.""

RELATED TOPICS
Singapore
(CNN) -- Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely credited with molding Singapore into one of the world's most prosperous countries, has been admitted to the hospital, officials said.
Lee, 87, was the founding father of the island nation. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is now Singapore's prime minister -- the country's third since it gained independence from Malaysia in 1965.
The elder Lee was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital on Wednesday evening for a chest infection, a spokeswoman said Thursday. She did not offer further details on his hospitalization.
Lee took a spill on Monday and had gone to the hospital on Tuesday for physical therapy but was able to speak at a business forum on Tuesday night.
Then-businessman Lee took over the helm of the swampy seaport of Singapore in 1959 and governed through the race riots of the 1960s.
He also molded Singapore into a major transport and financial services hub, with its port becoming one of the busiest around the globe.
But he also created a Singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum.
The elder Lee voluntarily stepped down in 1990 -- the first Southeast Asian strongman to do so -- and turned power over to Goh Chok Tong.
Goh ran a ""kinder, gentler Singapore"" and helped dilute the perceptions of a Lee family dynasty.
After 14 years in power -- steering Singapore through the 1997 financial crisis and the SARS outbreak, and reaching out to his neighbors and to the West -- 63-year-old Goh turned the office over to Lee's son in 2004.

209;"Five of the hostages are French. The other two are from Togo and Madagascar.
The French foreign ministry has confirmed the images are authentic and called them ""an encouraging sign"".
Two of the French nationals were employees of the French nuclear energy firm, Areva, which operates the mine near Arlit.
The other five hostages worked for a subsidiary of the French construction company, Vinci, which was a subcontractor there.
The hostages and their captors were last seen heading towards Inabangaret, an important well and stopping point in north-western Niger.
It is believed they are being held in the mountains of northern Mali.
Military search
In the images broadcast by al-Jazeera, the seven hostages are shown sitting cross-legged on sand with seven armed men standing behind them. The captors' faces are obscured by the turbans they are wearing.
The video featured them being asked in French about their names, ages, marital status, al-Jazeera said. When asked if they know the identity of their kidnappers, the hostages said they were members of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
It is not clear when the footage, which has now been posted online, was filmed.
The French foreign ministry said the group photograph had been authenticated.
""Even if we don't know when it was taken, it's an encouraging sign in as much as it shows all the hostages alive,"" a statement said, according to the AFP news agency.
An audio statement by AQIM broadcast by al-Jazeera last week said a group led by Sheikh Abou Zaid - its leader in northern Mali - had managed to evade the tight security in place at Arlit and kidnapped ""five French nuclear experts"" on 16 September.
Niger is the world's sixth biggest producer of uranium, and the radioactive heavy metal is its main export. Areva gets much of its uranium from the two mines it operates in the country, Arlit and Imouraren.
The French military is using reconnaissance planes to scour the desert for the hostages
France has sent 80 military personnel, as well as aircraft equipped with sophisticated monitoring equipment to Niger's capital, Niamey, to help search for them.
AQIM, a North African offshoot of al-Qaeda, is active in the region and has kidnapped French and other European nationals in the past.
In July, the group announced that it had executed a 78-year-old retired French engineer it was holding hostage in Mali, after a raid by the French and Mauritanian armed forces failed to free him.
The following month, the Spanish government is believed to have paid millions of euros to free two of its nationals seized by AQIM in Mauritania.

210;"EU austerity drive country by country
The cost of bailing out the Republic of Ireland's stricken banks has risen to 45bn euros (£39bn), opening a huge hole in the Irish government's finances.
The increased cost will see the government run a budget deficit equivalent to 32% of GDP this year.
The cost includes a bill of up to 34bn euro to rescue the worst-hit lender, Anglo Irish Bank.
The government said it would now have to rewrite its budget to cut borrowing more quickly in the coming years.
But Irish finance minister Brian Lenihan defended the action, saying Anglo Irish Bank was too big to fail.
The Republic had previously committed to bringing its budget deficit down from 14.3% of GDP last year to 3% by 2014.
In a statement, Mr Lenihan said he still intended to meet that target, indicating huge fiscal tightening over the next four years.
'Huge damage'
Mr Lenihan defended the cost of the bail-out measures, which will cost the Republic's two million taxpayers the equivalent of 22,500 euros each.
""The bank had grown to half the size of our annual national wealth, so clearly the failure of a bank on that scale would do huge damage to the local economy here in Ireland,"" he said in an interview with the BBC.

Stephanomics: The 32% question
The Irish economy  - once known as the Celtic Tiger - grew rapidly on the back of a property boom, fuelled by massive lending from the banks.
But when this collapsed, and lenders were unable to repay, the Irish banking system was plunged into crisis.
The cost of bailing out Anglo Irish could now cost between 29.3bn euros and 34bn euros in a worst-case ""stress scenario"", the government said.
That is up from the estimate of 22-25bn euro given last month.
The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, said the equivalent of about a third of the Irish economy had gone into supporting the banks:
""If you added together all the capital provided to Ireland's banks by various arms of the state, taxpayer support to those banks in the form of capital injections is around 30% of GDP.""
He said that would compare with around 6% of GDP in the UK for the equity injected into Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Northern Rock.
There will also be up to 7.2bn euros of additional support for Allied Irish Banks (AIB), which will in effect be nationalised.
Further help - of 2.7bn euros - will also be given to the Irish Nationwide Building Society.

Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said Anglo-Irish was a 'systemic threat'
The Bank of Ireland was not deemed to need any extra support.
Despite the size of the numbers involved, the latest news on the bail-out was welcomed by some market analysts.
Padhraic Garvey, rate strategist at ING, said: ""I think the market needs to know and here it is.""
This reassurance was reflected in a slight fall in the Republic's cost of borrowing, which had hit record levels earlier in the week.
However, others doubted this would be the last such announcement.
""Alas I don't think we have final figures. We've had about four 'final figures' for Anglo [Irish],"" said Brian Lucey, economics professor at Trinity College Dublin.
'Better health'
The Irish economy has faced one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, with its economy shrinking by 10% in 2009.
The latest GDP figures showed it contracted by 1.2% for the second quarter. Greece's GDP dropped by 1.5% in the same period.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Lenihan stressed that the country's financial health was better than other peripheral eurozone economies, saying it had borrowing already lined up to service debts and cover public services until the middle of 2011.
""We are not obliged to go to the markets. We are not under a clear and present constraint,"" he told the paper.
Mr Lenihan said the country would cancel its bond auctions in October and November and would not return to the bond markets until early in 2011.
The European Union's monetary commissioner, Olli Rehn, said he doubted that Ireland would need emergency aid from the fund established earlier this year by the EU and the International Monetary Fund to save Greece from bankruptcy.
There had been speculation that the Irish government would need such help - a suggestion rejected by the government.

Contador blames food contamination
Three-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador has claimed he is the victim of contaminated food after testing positive for a banned drug.
The muscle-building and fat-burning drug clenbuterol was detected in his system during this year's Tour.
Contador, 27, the greatest rider of his generation, said that contaminated meat brought in from Spain was responsible for his positive test on 21 July.
""It is a clear case of food contamination,"" stated the Spaniard.
Contador, who called himself a ""victim"", has been provisionally suspended by cycling's world governing body the UCI after his A and B samples tested positive.
A World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited lab in Cologne, Germany, found a ""very small concentration"" of clenbuterol in Contador's urine sample on 21 July at the Tour, according to the UCI.
Spain's Alberto Contador is cycling's biggest star
However, the amount was 400 times less than the 50 picogram benchmark measurement that anti-doping laboratories accredited by Wada must be able to detect.
BBC Radio 5 live's cycling reporter Simon Brotherton said that if the test failure is upheld, Contador could be stripped of his Tour de France title and also given a two-year ban from the sport as a first offender.
""But it sounds to me as if the UCI feels it's such a miniscule amount, and not one that would have potentially made any difference [to his performance], that it is keen to get to the bottom of this and feels it is worth investigating the claims Contador has made,"" he added.
The only previous Tour winner to be stripped of their title was Floyd Landis in 2006.
The American's allegations about drug use in the sport are part of an ongoing investigation by federal authorities in the United States.
Contador, who in August joined Bjarne Riis's Team Saxo Bank on a two-year deal after leaving the Astana team, said the meat was brought across the border from Spain to France during a rest day during the Tour.
He said there were complaints about the food at the hotel where his Astana team were staying.
The Spaniard revealed he ate the meat on 20 July and again on 21 July and at a specially arranged news conference in his home town of Pinto, he called the UCI's suspension of him ""a true mistake"".
He claimed: ""The UCI itself affirmed in front of me that it was a case of food contamination.
""This is a genuine mistake. I think it will be resolved in a clear way, with the truth up front,"" he said but added that the UCI ""understands that is a special case, which has to be examined"".
The rider, who appeared tense and sometimes on the verge of tears, stated he was ""sad and disappointed but with my head held high"".
He added: ""I've spent a month and half keeping this inside, without sleeping. My family didn't find out until last night.
""This is a real error. The system is very questionable and it has to be changed. I cannot tolerate the idea of a possible sanction.""
Contador's suspension is a huge blow to the sport, which has fought hard in the past few years to fight widespread doping by riders that has repeatedly sullied the Tour, its showpiece race.
Despite his protestations, the failed test threatens to leave an indelible stain on the record of the Spaniard, who also won the 2007 and 2009 Tours.
It makes no sense because it would have come up in other [doping] controls
David Millar
But British world time trial silver medallist David Millar backed Contador as a ""fantastic athlete and a great human being"" and believes the case should never have been made public because further investigation is needed.
Millar, who was banned from cycling for two years in 2004 after admitting to using the blood-booster EPO earlier in his career, feels there are a lot of questions that need to be answered before judging Contador.
""I think there's a very strong chance that this is being blown way out of proportion... because it's a micro-dose and it was on a rest day,"" said the Scot.
""It makes no sense because it would have come up in other [doping] controls. It's a shame that it has been released when it hasn't been resolved. It's something that should be resolved behind closed doors.
""There are strict rules and I think unfortunately in cycling, for the right reasons, we always jump to the worst-case scenario and because of the history we have in the sport unfortunately maybe Alberto's been thrown to the sharks.
""I think it will get resolved, and I hope so for Alberto's benefit and I hope so for the sport's benefit.""
Clenbuterol can strip fat and enhance muscle size and can also have a short-term stimulant effects, including increasing aerobic capacity, blood pressure and alertness. It has led to bans for cyclists in the past.
In similar ways to stimulant drugs such as amphetamine or ephedrine, it can increase the heart rate and body temperature.
Contador earned his third Tour de France victory this year
Athletes and body builders are thought to use it in combination with other performance-enhancers such as growth hormone and steroids to build and define muscles.
It is listed by Wada as an anabolic agent that is prohibited for use by athletes at all times, both in and out of competition.
American swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for clenbuterol at the US trials in July 2008 and served a one-year suspension that ended last summer.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport later accepted her explanation that she had unknowingly taken it in a contaminated food supplement.
A number of athletes have been suspended in recent months after using the banned drug, including Polish canoeist Adam Seroczynski, British hurdler Callum Priestley and Chinese Olympic judo champion Tong Wen.
In May, the UCI suspended Italy's Alessandro Colo after he tested positive for clenbuterol during the Tour of Mexico in April.
And Chinese rider, Li Fuyu, a member of Lance Armstrong's Team RadioShack, was suspended in April after testing positive for the drug during a Belgian race.

Although Ms Becker was arrested the month after the Buback assassination, after a shoot-out with police, there was insufficient evidence at the time to convict her of his murder.
She was sentenced to life imprisonment for her involvement in six other murders, but was pardoned by then-President Richard von Weizsaecker in 1989 and released.
She was rearrested in August 2009 and charged earlier this year with conspiracy to murder after new forensic technology allegedly revealed traces of Ms Becker's DNA on a letter by the RAF sent claiming responsibility for the Buback attack.
She is not accused of firing the shots that killed Buback - that person has never been found.
Ms Becker, wearing a large pair of dark sunglasses, declined via her lawyer to respond to the charges at the court in Stuttgart, in southern Germany.
Speaking before the trial opened, Siegfried Buback's son Michael said: ""We only want to know the truth, the truth about this crime, which my father and his two companions fell victim to. We have a very clear picture of what has happened, but this is not enough.""
The trial is expected to continue until December. Ms Becker faces a possible life sentence if convicted.

214;"Moody's downgrades Spain's credit rating
Spain's plans to cut its budget deficit have prompted strikes and protests
Spain has lost its last triple-A credit rating with the major rating agencies, following a downgrade from Moody's.
The agency downgraded Spanish debt by one level to Aa1, following similar moves by Fitch and Standard & Poor's earlier this year.
Moody's said the downgrade reflected the ""considerable deterioration"" in Spain's public finances.
The slow growth in the Spanish economy would also present challenges, it said.
Spain has been among the European countries to introduce tough austerity measures to tackle the problems in its public finances.
On Wednesday, Spanish unions held a general strike in protest against the cuts.
Growth worries
Despite the downgrade, Moody's said its outlook for Spain's creditworthiness was ""stable"", with the government expected to meet its deficit reduction targets over the next two years.
But the slow growth of the Spanish economy would make repairing the public finances more difficult, Moody's said.
Spain's economic growth is expected to average 1% a year over the next few years, Moody's lead analyst for Spain, Kathrin Muehlbronner said.
That compares with growth rates of 2% for the UK, and between 1.5% and 2% for German and France.
Spain's borrowing costs are currently nearly two percentage points higher than the borrowing costs for Germany - seen by lenders as Europe's safest economy.
But following the downgrade Spain's cost of borrowing on 10-year bonds actually fell slightly to 4.1%, reflecting relief among investors that the downgrade was not more severe.
However Spain's borrowing costs remain more than double their average rate for 2009, before this year's European debt crisis hit confidence.

The user's consent is required for any interception of e-mails or internet surfing, the Commission says, objecting to the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), which allows a person to intercept communications if he or she has ""reasonable grounds for believing"" that consent has been given.
The Commission says sanctions are required under EU law for any unlawful interception, whether done intentionally or not.
The EU rules define consent as ""freely given, specific and informed indication of a person's wishes"".
Dispute over ads
The Commission started the legal action following trials of the Phorm ad-serving system on BT's network in 2006 and 2007.
Although the UK government was happy with the way that the trial was run, critics said BT's customers who were unwittingly enrolled in it should have had the chance to opt out.
The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet transparency, welcomed the Commission's move on Thursday.
""This is great news; Phorm showed there are big holes in the UK privacy laws. We need an official body to deal with citizens' complaints about illegal commercial interception and enforce our legal privacy rights,"" said the group's director Jim Killock.
ORG was among the groups that complained about Phorm.
A UK Home Office spokesman said the government was disappointed that the Commission had decided to refer the case to the European Court of Justice.
""We are planning to make changes to address the Commission's concerns and will be setting out more detail on any necessary amendments or legislation in due course,"" the spokesman said.

His proposals seemed to satisfy Mr Fini's breakaway group, whose members indicated they would support the government, at least for now.
""We will not neglect our duty, we want to carry on till the end of the parliamentary term,"" said Italo Bocchino, an ally of the speaker, who was expelled from Mr Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in July.
With the support of the 34 deputies who support Mr Fini, the government won the vote comfortably by 342 votes to 275, with three abstentions.
However, shortly after the vote Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partner, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League, said it would have been better if the prime minister had been forced to call early elections.
""It's better to take the high road in life, and the high road is elections,"" he explained. ""Berlusconi didn't want elections and now we're at this point.""

217;"Air France-KLM faces legal claims it fixed cargo rates
Air France-KLM has paid fines in the US for fixing air cargo rates
Air France-KLM and sister cargo carrier Martinair are being sued by hundreds of European companies, led by Ericsson and Philips, the firms' lawyer says.
The carriers face claims of up to 500m euros ($681m; £432m) in compensation for alleged air cargo price-fixing.
They say they were overcharged by 10% on international air freight between 2000 and 2007 because of an illegal price-fixing deal between airlines.
The case is being brought in Amsterdam with papers to be filed on Thursday.
Air France-KLM, which has declined to comment, paid a fine of $350m for conspiring to fix prices for air cargo rates, following a US Justice Department probe in 2008.
It also agreed to an $87m settlement of its civil liabilities in the US.
'Unfair'
Litigation firm Claims Funding International (CFI) is representing the firms,  and is paying their legal costs in return for a commission only if the lawsuit is successful.
""It is unfair that the airline would pay money to its US victims but not its European victims,"" said Peter Koutsoukis, CFI managing director.
He added that CFI had opted for court action only when Air France-KLM did not respond to a request for negotiations.
CFI said there were several hundred claimants in the action from 11 EU countries, and numerous industries including the pharmaceutical, automotive, electronics, food and fashion sectors.
Sweden's Ericsson has said it is one of the lead claimants, and CFI has named Philips Electronics as the other lead claimant.

Speaking at the march, Jean Claude Mailly, head of the French union Force Ouvriere, said there was still time to rethink the austerity measures.
""It is never too late because the austerity measures are in the process of being set up now,"" he told the BBC.
""So we are in a period where social movements of a different nature will have a big value in the weeks and months to come. There is a strong social tension.""
Labour unions in Spain began the country's first general strike in eight years by marching through the capital, Madrid, in an effort to shut down the city.
Also in the capital, there were mass protests outside bus and metro stations, and few buses were running. Many high-speed trains were cancelled and only about a quarter of commuter trains were running.
Groups of strikers went into shops and banks trying to force them to close.
The airline Iberia said it expected to operate only 35% of scheduled flights.
'Banks to blame'
In the Irish Republic, a man drove a cement mixer covered with anti-bank slogans into the gates of the parliament in Dublin, in an apparent protest at the country's expensive bank bail-out.
Strikers held a protest in central Madrid, prompting some shops to close
The European Trade Union Confederation (Etuc) said the protesters were marching to voice their anger over budget-slashing plans and cuts which ""could lead Europe into a recession"".
The union warns that the financial crisis - which it describes as the worst in Europe since the 1930s - has already made 23 million people across the EU jobless. It fears that the austerity measures being implemented by various EU governments could ""result in even more unemployment"".
""We didn't cause this crisis. The bill has to be paid by banks, not by workers,"" Etuc said.
Instead, the organisation urges governments to guarantee workers stable jobs, strong social protection and better pensions.
Workers in many EU countries are frustrated that they are paying for the mistakes of the banks and the financial sector, the BBC's Christian Fraser in Brussels reports.
The recovery is still fragile. In some countries it has not even begun, and many fear the cuts could provoke further trouble, our correspondent says.
He adds that in short, it is a debate on austerity versus stimulus, cuts or spending, and the opinions are deeply and bitterly divided.

Police have been examining footprints left at the scene
Thieves in France have broken into a vineyard and stolen an entire crop of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, say police.
They struck in Villeneuve-les-Beziers on Sunday night, taking advantage of a full moon and using a harvesting machine to seize 30 tonnes of the crop.
Farmer Roland Cavaille said similar crimes had taken place before in the Languedoc-Roussillon, one of France's best-known wine growing regions.
He said the theft amounted to a year's work and about 15,000 euro (£12,900).
""They used a harvesting machine to gather grapes. This means there was no need to have lots of people, two people would have been enough,"" Mr Cavaille told Le Parisien newspaper.
""The area was quite isolated, it is a a few kilometres from the village and near a river. So the thieves were able to work safely.""
One witness reported hearing engine noises in the early hours of the morning and police have been examining footprints left at the scene, said the newspaper.
But Mr Cavaille said the thieves were clearly professionals who could easily sell on the grapes.
He said there had been a similar grape theft had been reported in the area four years ago and that another complaint had also been filed this year.
While his vineyard was insured, it did not cover the loss of the grapes themselves.
Mr Cavaille told Europe1 news he had no idea who had taken the grapes but that he was angered and surprised by the theft, as he believed there was a ""degree of solidarity"" between winemakers.

Mr Kostenko said that ""a number of agreements on partnership have already been signed"" with Energia and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos).
The project has Russian and American investors willing to inject hundreds of millions of dollars, he added.

Ms Reding says France has failed to transpose into law a 2004 EU directive on freedom of movement , which sets out procedures for deporting migrants deemed to be staying illegally.
The Roma sent home to Romania and Bulgaria are EU citizens, so they have the right to move to another EU country. But host countries can deport people considered to be a public security risk or a burden on the welfare system.
President Sarkozy says the illegal Roma camps threaten to become shanty towns. He launched the crackdown in late July, calling the camps breeding grounds for people trafficking, prostitution and child exploitation.
More than 1,000 Roma have been deported since Mr Sarkozy announced that the camps would be torn down.
Row over memo
A leaked memo from the French interior ministry infuriated Ms Reding earlier this month.
It showed the authorities had been instructed to target Roma camps, rather than deal with migrants on a case-by-case basis, as the French migration minister and the minister for Europe had assured the European Commission.
The deliberate targeting of an ethnic minority, if proven, would violate EU anti-discrimination laws and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
""France did not correctly transpose the rules on free movement of European citizens and, as a result, she has robbed these citizens of essential procedural guarantees,"" Ms Reding said on Wednesday.
""This must be corrected and that is why the Commission has acted firmly.""

The official notification about an infringement procedure will be sent to Paris if France does not tell the Commission within two weeks how it is transposing the directive into law and present a timetable for doing so.
The Commission heard presentations on Wednesday from Ms Reding and two other commissioners on France's expulsions of Roma.
""The Commission is analysing the situation of all other EU member states under the Directive on Free Movement, to assess whether it will be necessary to initiate infringement proceedings also in other cases,"" a Commission statement said.
It warned that infringement cases would be opened against other countries if they were found to be ignoring the directive.

222;"The new rules will require national governments not only to keep their deficits within the current limit of 3% of GDP, but also to actively reduce their total debt towards 60% of GDP.
Governments would be expected to cut one-20th of the excess debt every year.
So for example, a country with 100% debt-to-GDP ratio would be expected to cut it by 2% a year.
Most eurozone members are in breach of the 60% limit. Belgium, Italy and Greece have debt close to or in excess of 100% of their GDP.
And nearly all eurozone governments are currently in breach of the 3% deficit rule, as they struggle to cope with high unemployment and dismal growth.
However, there is expected to be a three-year grace period for governments to meet the financial rules.
Private debt
The desire to crack down on debt makes sense when looking at countries like Greece and Italy, which racked up huge debts in the good times, says BBC Europe business reporter Ben Shore.
But he adds that it does not solve the problems of a country such as Spain, which was never was a debt glutton and actually ran a budget surplus in the years leading up to the crisis.
However, that did not stop it being singled out by international investors as a big debt risk.
The Spanish economy experienced a property bubble fuelled by private household debt - not government borrowing - during the last decade.
That bubble then burst, bringing the construction sector - a major part of the Spanish economy - down with it.
The Commission also wants to address this problem of private sector debt accumulation - what it calls ""economic imbalances"" - with the threat of fines.
A country that has been identified by Brussels as at risk would face an in-depth review resulting in a ""corrective action plan"" - a set of policy demands that the scrutinised government must carry out.
The action plans would first have to be agreed with the other national governments. Failure to carry the plan out would lead to fines.
Big fines
The proposed punishments will raise eyebrows, our reporter adds.
The fine for breaking budget rules will be 0.2% of GDP.
Eurozone governments - but not the UK - would be expected to deposit this amount in an account, so it could be easily deducted if they persistently break the rules.
There would be a separate fine of 0.1% a year for governments who fail to enact their action plans to deal with ""economic imbalances"" when told to do so.
However, the Commission's monitoring and potential admonishment of offending governments may apply to all EU countries, including the UK.
Automatic punishment
More controversially, the Commission wants these sanctions to be automatic, but with a possible escape route if a transgressor can persuade other eurozone countries to let it off.
The Commission said that the proposed new framework would be ""more rules-based, and sanctions will be the normal consequence to expect for countries in breach of their commitments"".
The idea is a response to the failure of the the original ""stability and growth pact"" rules for the euro.
The old rules also said that governments were should be fined for their budgetary transgressions.
But the fines were never implemented, as even the likes of France and Germany failed to stay within the debt and deficit limits.
French disquiet
The French finance minister (centre) greets her Spanish peer as their more austere German counterpart looks on
The proposal for automatic fines is politically controversial, particularly with the French, as it would entail unelected bureaucrats punishing elected politicians.
""To foresee a completely automatic mechanism, a power totally in the hands of the experts, no!"" said French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde earlier this week.
She unveiled on Wednesday a budget for 2011 that is noticeably less austere than those of her eurozone neighbours.
Instead, the French government will rely on stimulating faster growth to help it bring debt-to-GDP and deficit-to-GDP ratios within the required limits.
Some economists also warn that in the current environment of anaemic consumer spending, fiscal austerity may prove self-defeating for countries like Ireland and Greece.
They say that the budget cuts will lead to recessions, meaning lower tax revenues, bigger unemployment benefit bills and falling GDP.
This could make the EU's targets for debt-to-GDP and deficit-to-GDP ratios unattainable.
German stringency
However, automatic fines - and eurozone government austerity - are being pushed by Germany.
Berlin has already gained support for its strict view from a separate taskforce set up by the eurozone governments to look into the debt crisis.
The Commission also announced a new drive to make sure EU countries are not massaging their statistics, in response to accusations that Greece consistently misreported how much it was borrowing.
Governments will need to bring all aspects of their budgetary process - including accounting systems, statistics and forecasts methodologies - into line with Europe-wide standards.

The report says that the sport in South America will be given a boost when the sport returns to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
""The combination of significant media attention in Asia due to the success of professional golfers from countries such as [South] Korea, and an increasingly affluent middle class in populous Asian markets such as China and India, could unleash a huge drive in the sport,"" says KPMG's Andrea Sartori.
""Equally, South America and, more particularly, Brazil, which will host the 2016 Olympics, offers significant potential.""
'Local demand'
Ms Sartori said Brazil's economic development could be matched over time by new golf courses and golfers.
Golfers such as Shanshan Feng of China have helped to boost the popularity of the game in Asia
""With three in every 10,000 people playing golf in South America and a total population of nearly 380 million, there appears to be a significant development opportunity to satisfy both local demand and international golf tourism demand,"" she added.
The KPMG report found that in the 32 tournament circuits analysed in 2009 there were 671 professional golf tournaments in 57 different countries.
The US and Europe continue to lead the field, with large prize-money funding.
The US PGA Tour remains the richest, with total prize money of 196.4m euros.
The European Tour has enjoyed substantial growth over the past 20 years, increasing its total prize money from 14m in 1989 to 135m in 2009.
'Most marketable'
The report also underlines golf's reputation as one of the most lucrative professional sports in the world - 62 players on the PGA Tour each won prize money of more than 1m euros in 2009.
One of the biggest earners is superstar Tiger Woods, which KPMG's report names as ""the most marketable golfer of all time"".
He is followed by Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer (joint second), Greg Norman (fourth) and Gary Player (fifth).

225;"Irish debt yields in new record despite better job data
Irish unemployment remains high despite falling for the first time since February
The cost of servicing Irish debt has hit a new record, despite data showing the first fall in unemployment since February.
The interest rate on Irish government debt has reached a high of 6.791%.
The rise comes as concerns about the country's economic health continue to nag at investors.
The latest official figures show a slight improvement in the unemployment rate, which fell back slightly for the first time since February.
Investors are focused on forthcoming news about the country's stricken Anglo Irish Bank, which needs another large injection of government money.
The country's Prime Minister, Brian Cowen, has been praised for taking early firm steps to tackle the Irish Republic's deficit.
Wind-down
But many problems remain, not least the final bill for winding down the nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.
Estimates for this are as high as 35bn euros (£30bn; $47.4bn) - more than 20% of Ireland's gross domestic product - and the details are expected to be given by the government on Thursday.
Further pressure looms from Europe in the form of new rules designed to clamp down on financial imprudence.
Snapshot
Meanwhile, there was a moderately positive snapshot of the economy from the Irish Central Statistics Office (COS), which said its standardised unemployment rate was 13.7% in September, down from 13.8% in August.
However, one month's data cannot be taken as a clear guide of economic health, and the rate is still higher than the 13.2% average for the second quarter of the year.
Other CSO data showed a fall in the number of people claiming benefits.
Fewer men and women are on the Live Register, which measures people either without work or with just part-time work who are drawing benefits.
That figure is just below 450,000, compared with August's count of 455,000.
The largest percentage decrease was in the professional group of workers, with 14% fewer on the register, followed by the clerical and secretarial group, where 11.8% fewer people registered.
Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said last week that he wanted to see the September jobless figures as well as September exchequer returns, due on Monday, before making adjustments to his fiscal forecasts, which are due next month.

I could be rested for a match - Westwood
38th Ryder Cup
Venue: Celtic Manor, Newport Date: 1-3 October Starts: 0745 BST on Friday Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live & online, live text commentary online & daily highlights on BBC TWO. Live on Sky Sports 1
Lee Westwood says he is ready to lead by example when he begins the European team's bid to win back the Ryder Cup from the United States at Celtic Manor.
Westwood has been paired with Martin Kaymer against Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in the first fourball.
""If I get out there - chest out, chin up - I've got the most experience and will try to show them how it's done,"" said the 37-year-old from Worksop.
The world number three has overcome a calf injury to play in his seventh Cup.
European team captain Colin Montgomerie revealed Westwood asked to follow Mickelson and Johnson's tee shots as part of the first group to tee off at 0745 BST on Friday.
ROB HODGETTS' BLOG
And earlier on Thursday, Westwood had spoken publicly of his desire to get Europe of to a flying start in their pursuit of the 14.5 points needed to wrestle the trophy from the United States.

Harrington reveals mentor role
""I'm going to go out there and try and hit the first fairway in my match. Try and knock it on the green, try and win that first hole, try and win a point that first morning,"" he said ahead of Thursday's announcement of the opening day's pairings.
Westwood had been surprisingly teamed up with rookie Rory McIlroy during final practice on Thursday, but Montgomerie resisted any temptation to spring a surprise and instead selected the 21-year-old Northern Ireland player alongside fellow countryman Graeme McDowell in the day's second group.
The 2009 Open champion Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar will form the opposition for McIlroy and McDowell.
Westwood has not played competitively in two months because of his calf problem, with his last tournament the Bridgestone Invitational back in early August.
When asked whether his injury had made him a doubt for the clash in Wales, Westwood responded: ""Yes, it did.
""I think when you go through a rehabilitation process, some weeks it moves quickly, other weeks, you don't see much of an improvement.
TWITTER UPDATES
Westwood says his calf injury is not an issue and is ready to play all five matches if needed

""It's a bit like building a house, if you go back every day, you don't see much of a change.
""It's just because it's something that I've never been through before and you don't know what to expect. It's a bit like being a rookie on the Ryder Cup team.""
Westwood admitted that the steep slopes on the Twenty Ten course and possibility of playing 36 holes a day would test his fitness, but added that he was confident of staying the pace.
""I wouldn't be here if I don't think I could play five matches,"" he added.
""So if Monty [Montgomerie] chooses to play me for five, then hopefully I'll be ready for it.
""I think we've got a strong enough team that we can rest players. It is a tough course physically and maybe the plan would be to rest players.""
Westwood, who made his Ryder Cup debut under Seve Ballesteros in 1997, has played 29 matches.
In foursomes, Westwood has six wins and three halves from 11 matches, while in fourballs his return is six wins and two halves from 12.
Europe's number one will leapfrog American Phil Mickelson to take the world number two spot next week - with only Tiger Woods standing between himself and the number one spot.

Monty reveals Seve's Ryder rallying call
Europe team-mate and another Ryder Cup rookie Peter Hanson has been given at least Friday morning to recover from a chest infection that forced him to pull out of last week's Vivendi Cup with a chest infection.
The Swede, along with Miguel-Angel Jimenez and Edoardo and Francesco Molinari, have been left out of the opening day's fourball action.
""I am feeling a lot better,"" stated 32-year-old Hanson, who is one of six debutants in Montgomerie's team.
""I had a bad cold that went down close to the lungs and into there, so it was a good decision to rest.
""I came here on Monday still not feeling great, but I have to say that from Tuesday morning to now it feels good.""
Hanson also commented on how the new experience of playing at the Ryder Cup would affect him.
""I think everybody is going to be nervous. It's hard as a rookie because you don't really know what to expect, but we have all been in positions,"" he added.
""Every time you get put in a new situation, I think you get that extra bit of nerve.
""I remember the first European Tour event I played on home soil in Sweden.

""I played as an amateur, and the feeling walking on to that first tee pretty close to where I live with packed grandstands all the way down, I think that feeling is going to be something similar to this.""
Tension is also something that Miguel-Angel Jimenez said he has been experiencing, despite the fact the Spaniard is set to make his fourth appearance in the competition.
""It's very tense, especially because it's getting so close now,"" said Jimenez, who at 46 is the oldest player on the 12-man Europe team.
""When you get here to the Ryder Cup, all week you feel like a knot in your stomach and tomorrow is getting closer and your knot is getting tight.""
He added: ""It's a good thing, yeah,"" he said. ""It's not nerves. It's something that you can afford, that you want.
""That makes you motivated more, and that's where you want to be. If you don't have those feelings, probably you're not here [in a good state of mind]. You need to feel things and that is important to you.""

227;"Fabian Cancellara beats David Millar to time trial gold
World Road Championships
Venue: Melbourne Dates: 29 Sept - 3 Oct Coverage: Live on BBC Red Button & online on 29 Sep (0600-0750), 30 Sep (0400-0835), 2 Oct (0400-0735, 2240-0610 - 3 Oct), 3 Oct (Highlights 1300-1400)
Cancellera takes fourth world crown
Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara beat Britain's David Millar to clinch a record fourth time trial title at the Road World Championships.
Cancellara charged through the 45.8km circuit in 58 minutes, 9.19 seconds to beat Millar by one minute, 2.75secs.
Germany's Tony Martin was third in Australia in a time of 59mins 21secs.
Cancellara, 29, previously won the time trial at the championships in 2006 and 2007 before also triumphing in 2009 in his native Switzerland.
Prior to the race, he had shared the record for victories with Australian Michael Rogers.
The 2003, 2004 and 2005 winner was an early pacesetter he was pushed down to fifth, behind countryman Richie Porte, who missed out on the bronze medal by only seven seconds.
Cancellara, who won gold and bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the time trial and road race, had been a doubt to compete in Melbourne after pulling out of September's Tour of Spain because of fatigue.
606: DEBATE
Cancellara is awesome. Great ride by Millar though
SteelTownCobra
He said he would only take part at the World Championships if he was ""at 100%"" of his ability and his victory in overcast, occasionally gusty conditions in the city port of Geelong - his third win in six time trials this year - vindicated his stance.
""I'm really happy to have done this a fourth time,"" said Cancellara, who had one nervous moment when he appeared to clip a barrier midway through his run. ""It's maybe the hardest of all my wins because leading up to this I wasn't sure of my condition.
""The other guys went really well but I just tried to do what I can. I think today I employed the perfect tactic.
""People always think Cancellara is always going to win but that is not always true.
""I had to find another motivation, the motivation was to make history and that is what helped me stay focused. Even if a rider is always winning, he can still have bad days.
""I want to enjoy this. Tomorrow morning when I wake up, then it's another day.""
The performance by 33-year-old Millar continued Britain's positive start to the World Championships after Emma Pooley became the first British woman to win gold in the time trial 24 hours earlier.

Fourth world time-trial title 'amazing' - Cancellera
Millar, who secured the silver medal in 2001 and won the 2003 title only to be stripped of it after admitting to doping, was fastest out of the blocks, leading the field over the first two time checks, but could not match Cancellara when he hit his stride.
""Congratulations to Fabian, there is no doubt that he is a phenomenon,"" stated the Scot. ""I came here to get on the podium and I achieved it.
""I am very happy with my ride. My power was good, but I need to be faster and corner faster to beat Fabian.""
Martin, who was third in last year's World Championships, was one of seven riders in the race from United States-based ProTour team HTC Columbia and was attempting to win his fifth time trial of the year after victories in the Tour of California, the Tour de Suisse, the Eneco Tour and the German championship.
He started out as Cancellara's biggest challenger, but lost valuable time waiting for a change of tyre after puncturing his front wheel during the race.
""It is hard to keep your motivation when you have a flat tyre because you know that it can be over but I saw Gustav Larsson still ahead of me and still continued to fight,"" added Martin.
US rider David Zabriskie, who was second in 2006 and third in 2008, finished eighth and Swede Larsson, who won time trials in the Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a Madrid, Tour du Limousin and Swedish national championship, was 10th.

President: Bamir Topi
A research scientist and senior member of Prime Minister Berisha's Democratic Party, Mr Topi was elected president for a five-year term by parliament in July 2007. Albanian is a parliamentary republic, and executive power resides with the cabinet of ministers.
Prime minister: Sali Berisha
The centre-right Democratic Party led by the former president, Sali Berisha, was re-elected by a narrow margin in parliamentary elections in July 2009, defeating the main opposition Socialists.
The election count, which produced the closest result since Albania toppled communism in 1990, was accompanied by disputes over procedure and claims of intimidation.
Sali Berisha was re-elected in July 2009
The Socialists refused to recognise the election result, and egan a campaign of mass protests and civil disobedience in support of demands for a partial recount.
Mr Berisha first became prime minister following victory in general elections in July 2005.
That vote was also followed by wrangling over the count, with re-runs demanded in a number of constituencies. It was nearly two months before the result was finally declared.
An erstwhile communist, Mr Berisha formed the Democratic Party in the early 1990s and in 1992 became Albania's first non-communist president since the Second World War.
His bid to liberalise the economy fast increased hardship for the majority. His presidency came to an end in 1997 when the collapse of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes led to violent unrest.
As prime minister, Mr Berisha promised to stamp out corruption, reduce taxation, attract greater foreign investment and develop the infrastructure.
He succeeded in gaining Albania Nato membership in April 2009, and the country formally applied for European Union membership the same month after a June 2006 Stabilisation and Association agreement.
Born in 1944 and a former heart specialist, Mr Berisha is known as an orator and has faced accusations of authoritarianism in the past.

One of the earliest Christian civilisations, its first churches were founded in the fourth century. It later spent centuries largely under Turkic or Persian control and its rich cultural and architectural heritage combines elements from different traditions. The Armenian language is part of the Indo-European family but its alphabet is unique.
Yerevan wants the world, and particularly Turkey, to recognize that the killing by the Ottoman Empire of hundreds of thousands of Armenians between 1915 and 1917 was genocide. Turkey says that there was no genocide and that the dead were victims of World War I. The governments of the two countries agreed to normalise relations in October 2009, although Turkey has said opening the border will depend on progress on the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
Republic Square in Yerevan
An independent Republic of Armenia was proclaimed at the end of the first world war but was short-lived, lasting only until the beginning of the 1920s when the Bolsheviks incorporated it into the Soviet Union.
When Soviet rule collapsed in 1991, Armenia regained independence but retained a Russian military base at Gyumri.
In the mid-1990s the government embarked on an economic reform programme which brought some stability and growth. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 2001.
Unemployment and poverty remain widespread. Armenia's economic problems are aggravated by a trade blockade, imposed by neighbouring Turkey and Azerbaijan since the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict over the predominantly Armenian-populated region in Azerbaijan overshadowed Armenia's return to independence in 1991.
Full-scale war broke out the same year as ethnic Armenians in Karabakh fought for independence, supported by troops and resources from Armenia proper. A ceasefire in place since 1994 has failed to deliver any lasting solution.
There is concern over safety at the Metsamor nuclear plant west of Yerevan. It was closed in 1988 following a catastrophic earthquake in the area but reopened in 1995 for economic reasons. The country is heavily reliant on it for electricity.
Armenia receives most of its gas supply from Russia and, like some other republics of the former Soviet Union, has had to face sharp price rises. The Russian gas giant Gazprom more or less doubled the price in April 2006. Russian gas arrives via a pipeline running through Georgia.
Armenia has a huge diaspora and has always experienced waves of emigration, but the exodus of recent years has caused real alarm. It is estimated that Armenia has lost up to a quarter of its population since independence, as young families seek what they hope will be a better life abroad.
Conversely, Armenia is richly endowed with potential as a tourist destination and recent figures indicate that some success is being achieved in attracting visitors.

Heinz Fischer, a centrist politician committed to the welfare state and Austrian neutrality, was elected to the largely ceremonial presidency in April 2004 and again 2010.
Heinz Fischer - committed to the welfare state
In the 2010 poll he warded off a challenge by Barbara Rosenkranz of the anti-foreigner and anti-European Union Freedom.
He has spent most of his life in politics. After graduating with a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1961, he took a position in the Social Democratic Party (SPOe), entering parliament as a deputy in 1971 and staying on until 2004.
During this time, he served as science and research minister between 1983 and 1987, before being elected parliamentary president in 1990. He was re-elected three times.
Between 1992 and 2004, he was also a vice-president of the European Socialist Party.
Once in office, he officially renounced any party membership to become independent.
Chancellor: Werner Faymann
Mr Faymann is seen as a pragmatis
A new grand coalition government was sworn in in Austria in December 2008, two months after snap general elections.
It is made up of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPO) and the conservative People's Party, whose previous coalition collapsed during the summer.
Social Democrat leader Werner Faymann took the job of chancellor, while Josef Proell of the People's Party serves as vice chancellor and finance minister.
The Social Democrats won the September elections with 30% of the vote. But they, and the People's Party, with 26%, suffered their worst results since 1945. Far-right parties won nearly 29% of the vote, doubling their support since the 2006 elections.
Mr Faymann is a former Vienna city councillor and was transport and infrastructure minister in the cabinet of his predecessor, Alfred Gusenbauer. He is seen as a pragmatist with a populist streak.
In his inaugural address, Mr Faymann stressed the need for political compromise among members of the previously fractious coalition, and he outlined measures for helping the country to deal with the global economic downturn.

232;"Ilham Aliyev took over as president from his father, Heydar, in 2003.
Ilham Aliyev succeeded his father Heydar as president
Heydar Aliyev described his son as his ""political successor"". When his father died, Ilham was already prime minister, vice chairman of the state oil company and deputy leader of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party (NAP).
He won the 2003 presidential elections by a landslide. Western observers were highly critical of the campaign which they said had been marred by voter intimidation, violence and media bias. Opposition demonstrations were met with police violence. There were many arrests.
Heydar Aliyev, a former Soviet Communist leader, reinvented himself as a post-independence political strongman and had ruled Azerbaijan with an iron fist since 1993 following a period of great instability. His record on human rights and media freedom was often criticised in the West.
The opposition continues to have strong doubts about Ilham Aliyev's commitment to democracy.
These were reinforced when police used force to break up opposition demonstrations in Baku in the run-up to and following November 2005 parliamentary elections in which the ruling NAP won well over half of the seats. OSCE and Council of Europe observers declared that the vote fell a long way short of international standards.
Mr Aliyev won a second term of office in 2008, scoring an overwhelming victory in an election that was boycotted by the main opposition parties. Western observers said that although the conduct of the election represented a marked improvement on previous votes, it still fell short of fully democratic standards.
He looked set to cement his grip on power even further when a move to lift the two-term limit on the president was approved in a referendum in March 2009, paving the way for a possible third term.
Ilham Aliyev was born in 1961 and has a doctorate in history. His business interests have enabled him to build substantial personal wealth since independence. He is married with three children.

It has been ruled with an increasingly iron fist since 1994 by President Alexander Lukashenko. Opposition figures are subjected to harsh penalties for organising protests.
In early 2005, Belarus was listed by the US as Europe's only remaining ""outpost of tyranny"". Since late 2008, there have been signs of a slight easing of tensions with the West - a development initially viewed with some concern by Russia, which has since begun to distance itself from Lukashenko's personal rule.

Politics: President Lukashenko is seen as ""Europe's last dictator"". He's been in power since 1994
Economy: Soviet-style economy is considered to have been subsidised by cheap Russian gas
International: A key oil and gas pipeline from Russia to Europe runs through Belarus
Timeline
The country became independent in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
More than a decade later, the sense of national identity is weak, international isolation continues and the nature of political links with Russia remains a key issue.
In the Soviet post-war years, Belarus became one of the most prosperous parts of the USSR, but with independence came economic decline. President Lukashenko has steadfastly opposed the privatisation of state enterprises. Private business is virtually non-existent. Foreign investors stay away.
For much of his career, Mr Lukashenko has sought to develop closer ties with Russia. On the political front, there was talk of union but little tangible evidence of progress, and certainly not toward the union of equals envisaged by President Lukashenko.
Belarus remains heavily dependent on Russia to meet its own energy needs and a considerable proportion of Russian oil and gas exports to Europe pass through it.
Russia's role as a major energy supplier to the rest of Europe and Belarus's position as a key transit country have come under the spotlight several times since 2006, when tensions first arose between Moscow and Minsk over the price of Russian gas and Belarus's privileged access to duty-free oil.
Relations with Russia deteriorated sharply in the summer of 2010, with disputes over energy pricing, customs union terms and the presence in Belarus of ousted Kyrgyz president Bakiyev, prompting speculation that Moscow might switch support from Lukashenko to another leadership candidate.

He stayed on in a caretaker capacity until early parliamentary elections on 13 June. The separatist New Flemish Alliance emerged as the largest single grouping from the vote, although the French and Flemish Socialists together had more seats overall.
Belgium's fractured political landscape means coalition negotiations are often a complex and lengthy process, and there are fears that this could leave the country without a stable government when the country assumes the EU's rotating presidency in July 2010.
During the three years since the previous general election, in July 2007, Mr Leterme held the prime ministerial office twice and offered his resignation three times.
Though his Flemish Christian Democrats emerged as the clear winners in the 2007 election, a long period of deadlock followed as he struggled to form a coalition government, which then lurched from one crisis to another for most of 2008.
Mr Leterme made little headway on the vital issue of devolving more powers to Belgium's regions, and his premiership saw frequent flare-ups of tensions between the French- and Dutch-speaking communities.
The first time that Mr Leterme tendered his resignation, King Albert II refused to accept it. When he offered to resign for the second time, in December 2008, his departure was occasioned not by inter-communal tensions but by a banking bailout scandal at the height of the global financial crisis.
Mr Leterme was then succeeded by his Flemish Christian Democrat colleague Herman Van Rompuy, who a year later became President of the European Council, leaving the Belgian premiership vacant once more.
On re-assuming office in November 2009, Mr Leterme identified economic recovery and the threat of rising unemployment as his government's priorities. However, it was the divisive linguistic issue that brought about the fall of the government.

It is now an independent state, but under international administration. Its three main ethnic groups are Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs. The war left Bosnia's infrastructure and economy in tatters. Around two million people - about half the population - were displaced.
International administration, backed at first by Nato forces and later by a smaller European Union-led peacekeeping force, has helped the country consolidate stability.
Symbol of hope: Rebuilt bridge at Mostar
But early in 2007 the International Crisis Group, a think tank, warned: ""Bosnia remains unready for unguided ownership of its own future - ethnic nationalism remains too strong.""
The 1995 Dayton peace accord, which ended the Bosnian war, set up two separate entities; a Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the Bosnian Serb Republic, or Republika Srpska, each with its own president, government, parliament, police and other bodies.
Overarching these entities is a central Bosnian government and rotating presidency. In addition there exists the district of Brcko which is a self-governing administrative unit, established as a neutral area placed under joint Serb, Croat and Bosniak authority.
Dayton also established the Office of the High Representative (OHR). The Office's representative is the state's ultimate authority, responsible for implementation of Dayton and with the power to ''compel the entity governments to comply with the terms of the peace agreement and the state constitution''.
Critics of Dayton said the entities it created were too close to being states in their own right and that the arrangement reinforced separatism and nationalism at the expense of integration.
Negotiations to amend the existing constitution, established by Dayton, in order to strengthen state institutions and transform the country into a non-ethnic parliamentary democracy, have so far failed to make much progress.
EU talks
In a bid to encourage Bosnia to resolve its ethnic divisions and eventually qualify for EU membership, EU foreign ministers gave the go-ahead in late 2005 for talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the country.
The prospect of talks with the EU is thought to have increased pressure for the capture of two key Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
After nearly 13 years on the run, Radovan Karadzic was arrested in July 2008 by Serbian security forces in Belgrade. His trial on war crimes charges opened at the UN tribunal in The Hague in October 2009.
But local elections in October 2008 had in the meantime reinforced Bosnia's ethnic divisions, with nationalist parties doing well among all three ethnic groups.
And only days before the Karadzic trial opened, efforts by the EU and US to break the stalemate on constitutional reform and prepare the country for eventual EU and Nato membership ended in failure when leaders of the three main ethnic groups rejected the proposals.
The Bosnian Serb leadership in particular continues to be resentful at having to accept the authority of the OHR, giving rise to suspicions that its ultimate goal is for the Republika Srpska to break away from the Bosniak-Croat Federation.

The centre-right GERB party led by Sofia mayor Boiko Borisov was the clear winner in general elections held in July 2009.
Voters punished the Socialist-led governing coalition of Sergei Stanishev for failing to crack down on corruption and organised crime.
Mr Borisov's poll campaign centred on promises to jail corrupt officials and mafia bosses and pull the country out of its worst economic downturn in years.
Boiko Borisov
Mr Borisov is a black belt and former coach of the national karate team, who began his career as a fireman in Communist Bulgaria. He created a private security company in the early 1990s and was bodyguard to both the ousted dictator Todor Zhivkov and to exiled Bulgarian king Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
After Mr Saxe-Coburg-Gotha became prime minister in 2001, he appointed Mr Borisov to one of the top jobs in the Interior Ministry.
While there, Mr Borisov earned himself the image of a tough operator, but his critics accused him of populism, arguing that his well-publicised actions did not result in a serious crackdown on organised crime.
He was elected an MP in 2005, but resigned his seat, opting to run successfully for mayor of the capital Sofia several months later. He formed GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria) the following year.
As leader of the new government, Mr Borisov is faced with the task of changing Bulgaria's image as one of Europe's most corrupt countries in the middle of an economic crisis. He has said he may ask the International Monetary Fund for help, a move that was resisted by his predecessor.

The country hopes to become a member of the EU by 2011 - representing remarkable progress since the time of Tudjman's death in December 1999, when the country was in a parlous state.
Its citizens suffered from government-backed attacks on their civil and political rights. The governing party, the HDZ, was then corrupt and the economy was in difficulties, with around 20% of Croatians unemployed.
Presidential and parliamentary elections at the beginning of 2000 ushered in politicians who pledged commitment to Croatia's integration into the European mainstream.
The constitution has been changed to shift power away from the president to the parliament. Croatia has joined the World Trade Organisation and has pledged to open up its economy. It has achieved growth and inflation is under control.
However, organised crime and mafia-linked violence have continued to be a major concern, and the government is seeking to demonstrate that it is serious about tackling the problem so as not to jeopardise its EU membership aspirations.
A dispute with Slovenia over sea and land borders dating back to the break-up of Yugoslavia also threatened to derail Croatia's journey to EU membership until June 2010, when a Slovene referendum cleared the main obstacle to Croatia's EU accession.

In 1974 the island was effectively partitioned with the northern third inhabited by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots.
A ""Green Line"" - dividing the two parts from Morphou through Nicosia to Famagusta - is patrolled by United Nations troops.
The UN drew up the Green Line as a ceasefire demarcation line in 1963 after intervening to end communal tension. It became impassable after the Turkish invasion of 1974, except for designated crossing points.
The island's partition has been in place since 1974
In 1983 the Turkish-held area declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The status of Northern Cyprus as a separate entity is recognised only by Turkey, which keeps around 30,000 troops in the north of the island.
The prospect of EU enlargement concentrated minds in the search for a settlement. UN-sponsored negotiations continued throughout 2002 and a peace plan was tabled. Soon afterwards the EU invited Cyprus to become a member.
But hopes that the island could join united were dashed when leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities failed to agree to the UN plan by the March 2003 deadline.
In the months that followed travel restrictions were eased, enabling people to cross the border for the first time in nearly 30 years, raising hopes that progress might be on the way.
As EU entry approached, a revised UN reunification plan was put to both communities in twin referendums in April 2004.
The plan was endorsed by Turkish Cypriots - though not by their then leader Rauf Denktash - but overwhelmingly rejected by Greek Cypriots. Because both sides had to approve the proposals, the island remained divided as it joined the EU in May. EU laws and benefits apply only to the Greek Cypriot community.
More than two years later, hopes of progress were rekindled at UN-sponsored talks between Cypriot President Tassos Papadopolous and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. The two agreed on a series of confidence-building measures and contacts between the communities.
Hopes were given further impetus by the election of Demetris Christophas as president in February 2008. He immediately began talks with Mehmet Ali Talat on reuniting the country as a bizonal federal state.
However, the initial optimism faded as talks made only slow progress through 2008, and hopes for a deal were dealt a blow by the victory of right-wing nationalists at parliamentary elections in northern Cyprus in April 2009.
Talks stalled through 2009, and the nationalists consolidated their dominance of northern Cyprus by winning the presidential election there in April 2010.
Turkey has a particular interest in seeing the situation resolved as its own EU aspirations are linked to the island's future.

He was the architect of Czech post-communist economic reforms, serving as finance minister in the first post-communist government and prime minister between 1992 and 1997 before financial scandals contributed to the fall of his government.
Mr Klaus is a bitter opponent of closer EU integration - although he insists that his views are more ""Eurorealist"" than ""Eurosceptic"". He signed the ""Lisbon"" European Union reform treaty in November 2009, the last European leader to do so.
Prime Minister: Petr Necas
The head of the centre-right Civic Democrat party (ODS), Petr Necas, was asked by President Klaus to form a government after the May 2010 general election.
Petr Necas has vowed to push through an austerity budget
Prior to the election, the Czech Republic had been in political limbo for over a year, and Mr Necas inherits a difficult job.
For the past year, the caretaker government of Jan Fischer has been keeping things ticking over, but pressing problems such as the country's swelling deficit have yet to be dealt with.
Mr Necas formed a coalition with the right-wing TOP 09 party and the centrist Public Affairs party.
Between them, the three parties hold 118 out of the 200 seats in the Czech parliament.
They are agreed that reducing the budget deficit should be the priority of the new coalition.
A physicist by training, Petr Necas joined the ODS in 1991. He was first elected to parliament in 1996 and became minister of labour and social affairs in 2006.
He succeeded Mirek Topolanek as leader of the ODS in March 2010.

Tallinn: The Capital's long history is evident in its old town
Timeline
Estonia was part of the Russian empire until 1918 when it proclaimed its independence. Russia recognised it as an independent state under the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.
During the two decades that followed it tried to assert its identity as a nation squeezed between the rise of Nazism in Germany and the dominion of Stalin in the USSR.
After a pact between Hitler and Stalin, Soviet troops arrived in 1940 and Estonia was absorbed into the Soviet Union. Nazi forces pushed the Soviets out in 1941 but the Red Army returned in 1944 and remained for half a century.
The rapidly expanding Soviet planned economy brought hundreds of thousands of Soviet immigrants to Estonia, causing widespread fear among Estonians that their national identity would eventually vanish.
Russians account for up to a third of the population.
The legacy of the Soviet years has left a mark which the country carries with it into its EU era: Many Russian-speakers complain of discrimination, saying strict language laws make it hard to get jobs or citizenship without proficiency in Estonian. Some Russian-speakers who were born in Estonia are either unable or unwilling to become citizens because of the language requirements.
After a decade of negotiations, Estonia and Russia signed a treaty defining the border between the two countries in May 2005. The Estonian parliament ratified it soon afterwards but only after it had introduced reference to Soviet occupation. Moscow reacted by pulling out of the treaty and saying talks would have to start afresh.
The Estonian language is closely related to Finnish but not to the languages of either of the other Baltic republics, Latvia and Lithuania, or to Russian. The country has unique traditions in folk song and verse, traditions which have had to be strong to survive the many centuries of domination by foreign countries.
Estonia enjoyed an investment boom following EU accession, but in 2008 its economy was badly hit by the global financial crisis.
With the economy expected to shrink by about 15 percent this year, the government has adopted austerity measures in an effort to stay on course for euro entry in 2011.

He cast himself as a moderniser and claimed to represent a clean break with the country's traditional ruling elite. His first cabinet had a definite new look, with more female ministers than previous French governments.
He had fought his election campaign on a promise to introduce pro-market reforms to tackle sluggish economic growth and high unemployment. He vowed to cut taxes, rein in powerful trades unions and reduce public spending.
The implementation of Mr Sarkozy's policies was bound to hit public sector workers hard, and since he assumed the presidency there have been regular public sector strikes in protest at planned cuts to pay and pension benefits.
On foreign policy, Mr Sarkozy has singled out France's role in Europe as a priority. He campaigned vigorously for ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which was intended to replace the draft EU constitution rejected by French voters in 2005.
He has also taken a lead in calling for fundamental reform of the world's financial system in response to the global credit crunch.
He is seen as being more pro-American than previous French presidents. He cultivated close ties with US President George W. Bush and has made no secret of his admiration for Bush's successor, Barack Obama.
Tough domestic challenges - by the spring of 2010, unemployment was running at more than 10% - led to widespread disillusionment with Mr Sarkozy's leadership, and in March of that year his party suffered a bruising defeat in regional elections.
His popularity was further damaged by allegations that his election campaign had been partly funded by illegal donations from France's richest woman, the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.

President: Mikhail Saakashvili
Mikhail Saakashvili was elected president in January 2004, and won a second term in an early election in January 2008, called in response to opposition protests.
President Saakashvili has pursued a strongly pro-Western course
In 2004, Mr Saakashvili led the ''Rose Revolution'' protests which forced his predecessor as president, Eduard Shevardnadze, to resign, riding a wave of popular anger at a parliamentary rigged election.
He won an overwhelming majority in the subsequent presidential election, in a vote praised by OSCE observers. Soon after that, his National Movement-Democratic Front won a resounding victory in parliamentary elections.
He faced a major challenge towards the end of 2007, when accusations of corruption and organising a murder by one-time ally and former Defence Minister Irakli Okruashvili triggered a wave of mass protests demanding elections.
The opposition accused him of authoritarianism and not doing enough to alleviate poverty. Mr Saakashvili sent in the riot police and imposed a state of emergency and accused Russia of fomenting the unrest.
He also brought forward presidential elections to 5 January 2008, which he won in the first round. His party went on to win a landslide victory in parliamentary elections in May 2008.
The outbreak of armed conflict with Russia in August 2008 led many Georgians who had previously accused Mr Saakashvili of authoritarian tendencies to rally behind him.
But criticism of his role in provoking the conflict mounted in the years following the war, and the opposition has organised several mass rallies demanding that he step down.
A protégé of Mr Shevardnadze early in his career, Mr Saakashvili says he grew disillusioned by widespread corruption in high places. He became justice minister in 2000 and launched a high-profile campaign against it, sparking a major public row with Mr Shevardnadze.
On becoming president Mr Saakashvili vowed to restore Georgia's territorial integrity by returning the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to the fold. Moscow's links with both have been a constant bone of contention. His ambition to take Georgia into Nato and the EU further soured relations with the Kremlin.
Mr Saakashvili was born in Tbilisi in 1967. He trained as a lawyer in the US and other countries and became a member of the Georgian parliament in 1995. He speaks several languages, including fluent English.
Prime Minister: Nikoloz ""Nika"" Gilauri
A business manager and long-serving minister, Nika Gilauri became prime minister in February 2009. He succeeded Grigol Mgaloblishvili, who resigned on health grounds after only three months in office.
PM Gilauri has sought to deregulate Georgia's economy
Born in Tbilisi in 1975, Mr Gilauri studied business and finance in Ireland and the United States, and worked as a manager abroad and in Georgia.
He joined the government as energy minister in 2004, after the election of President Mikhail Saakashvili, and went on to negotiate major gas supply deals with Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.
He took over as finance minister in September 2007, combining the job with the newly-created post of first deputy prime minister in Mr Mgaloblishvili's government from November 2008.
Mr Gilauri said that his priorities would be to tackle unemployment, further democracy and work to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia under Georgian control. He repeated previous governments' commitment to Georgia's integration with NATO.
His first major step was to dismiss Kakha Bendukidze, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in Russia in the 1990s and later spearheaded Georgia's privatisation drive, as head of the Georgian State Chancellery.
Mr Bendukidze's role in the deregulation of the Georgian economy had made him a regular target of opposition criticism and had also brought him into conflict with Mr Gilauri.

Angela Merkel has seen her popularity eroded by austerity measures
Profile: Angela Merkel
Mrs Merkel, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), first took office in an 2005. As a result of the vote's close result, she became chancellor in a ""grand coalition"" involving the CDU, its Christian Social Union (CSU) allies and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
In 2009, her party secured another four-year mandate with enough votes to dump the previous awkward coalition with the SPD in favour of an alliance with the smaller, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
The coalition faced tough challenges. Germany's export-dependent economy was hit hard by the global financial crisis of 2008-9, which triggered the worst recession since the foundation of the post-war Federal Republic in 1949.
Mrs Merkel won plaudits for her calm handling of the situation, and in 2009, Forbes magazine put her at the top of its list of the world's 100 most powerful women for the fourth year in a row.
However, clouds began to gather in early 2010, when Greece's vast debt burden sparked fears for the stability of the euro. Mrs Merkel persuaded parliament to approve a 22.4bn-euro German contribution to an EU loan for Greece, but observers abroad accused her of acting too slowly.
Many German voters, meanwhile, were angered by the perceived need to pay for another country's debts, and soon after, Mrs Merkel's coalition lost a key regional vote, and with it her majority in the powerful upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.
The setback meant she would have to rely on deals with opposition regional leaders to pass some legislation.
She suffered further embarrassment and loss of credibility when her favoured candidate for the presidency, Christian Wulff, failed to win an absolute majority in the first two rounds of voting, only securing the post in the third round.
During her first term in office, Mrs Merkel steered a centrist course at home and earned a reputation as a talented mediator at the international level. She became leader of the CDU in 2000 after Helmut Kohl was brought down by a party funding scandal.
She was born in Hamburg in 1954 but grew up in East Germany where her father was a Protestant clergyman. She holds a doctorate in physics.
She divorced her first husband Ulrich Merkel in 1982 and has been married to publicity-shy chemistry professor Joachim Sauer since 1998. She has no children.

Prime minister: George Papandreou
Mr Papandreou is the scion of a powerful political dynasty
Mr Papandreou has been leader of the Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) since February 2004, and led the party to defeat in the general elections of that year and 2007, before winning in October 2009.
He was elected on a programme of stimulating the economy, promoting green policies and combating corruption in public life.
However, his first challenge was the country's calamitous economic and financial crisis, and above all its vast public debt.
From December 2009, under severe pressure from the markets to curb the budget deficit, Mr Papandreou announced several rounds of tough austerity measures, including public sector pay cuts, fuel increases, and a crackdown on tax evasion.
However, these steps failed to halt the crisis, and in spring 2010, Greece came close to being unable to meet all of its debt repayments, putting pressure on the European common currency, the euro.
After intensive talks with other eurozone governments, particularly Germany, Mr Papandreau unveiled a new round of even tougher austerity measures, including deeper cuts in pensions and public sector pay, in return for a $145bn bailout package.
The son and grandson of prime ministers, Mr Papandreou was foreign minister in the previous Pasok government in 1999-2004. As deputy foreign minister in 1997 he had ministerial responsibility for Greece's successful bid to host the 2004 Olympics.
Mr Papandreou was born in the United States, where his father was a college lecturer, and educated there and in Canada, Sweden and Britain as a sociologist before returning with his father to Greece after the fall of the dictatorship in 1974.

It has especially rich traditions in folk and classical music and was the birthplace of numerous outstanding performers and composers, including Franz Liszt, Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly.
Hungary became a partner in the Austro-Hungarian empire in the mid-19th century. After a period of turmoil following World War I, an independent kingdom of Hungary was established.
The redrawing of European borders that took place after World War I left about five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. Their status remains a sensitive issue and has complicated Hungary's relations with its neighbours.
Following World War II, the country found itself under communist rule. An uprising against Soviet domination in 1956 was crushed by Red Army forces but Hungary did later become the first Eastern European country to gain some economic freedom. It embraced aspects of the free market while still under communist rule and in 1968 the authorities allowed limited decentralisation of the economy.
Budapest, the capital, straddles the Danube river.

Hungary played an important part in accelerating the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe when in 1989 it opened its border with Austria, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. Just a few months later the Berlin Wall was history.
Hungary's post-communist economic transition was achieved relatively smoothly. Within four years of the collapse of communism nearly half of the country's economic enterprises had been transferred to the private sector, and by 1998 Hungary was attracting nearly half of all foreign direct investment in its region.
Ten years later, the picture looked rather less rosy. A high level of both private and state borrowing left the country particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch of 2008, and in October of that year the government was forced to appeal to international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for massive loans in a bid to stave off economic collapse.
Dissatisfaction with the centre-left coalition government's handling of the economy from 2002 to 2010 coincided with the rise of the right-wing nationalist party Jobbik, known for its anti-Semitic and anti-Roma (Gypsy) rhetoric.

248;"In recent years Iceland enjoyed a standard of living that was among the highest in the world. Its prosperity initially rested on the fishing industry, but with the gradual contraction of this sector the Icelandic economy developed into new areas.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
By the beginning of the 21st century, Iceland had come to epitomise the global credit boom. Its banks expanded dramatically overseas and foreign money poured into the country, fuelling exceptional growth.
Before the global credit crunch took hold, Icelandic banks had foreign assets worth about 10 times the country's GDP, with debts to match, and Icelandic businesses also made major investments abroad.
The global financial crisis of 2008 exposed the Icelandic economy's dependence on the banking sector, leaving it particularly vulnerable to collapse.
In October 2008, the government took over control of all three of the country's major banks in an effort to stabilise the financial system. Shortly after this, Iceland became the first western country to apply to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency financial aid since 1976.
Environmental issues
An Icelandic hot spot: Geothermal waters of the Blue Lagoon
In the long term, Iceland's well educated workforce and its extensive and as yet largely untapped natural resources are likely to provide the key to its recovery from the economic crisis, though concerns have been raised over the potential environmental impact of developing the latter.
Environmentalists have protested that a major aluminium smelter project and associated geothermal and hydroelectric schemes were being pushed through at the expense of fragile wildlife habitats.
The country has extended its territorial waters several times since the end of the 1950s to protect its fishermen and their main catch of Atlantic cod from foreign fleets.
Traditionally a whaling nation, Iceland abandoned the practice in 1989 in line with an international moratorium. It later resumed scientific whaling, intended to investigate the impact of whales on fish stocks, and in 2006 it announced a return to commercial hunts. The move was condemned by environmental groups.
Although it has no armed forces, Iceland is a member of Nato, and US troops were stationed in the country from World War II until 2006. In 1985 Iceland declared itself a nuclear-free zone.
Icelanders have for a long time been resistant to the idea of joining the European Union, though the country is a member of the Schengen border-free travel zone and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
Attitudes towards the EU slowly softened, and in July 2009 the country formally applied for EU accession.
The government hopes that the path to EU membership will be completed by 2012, but there are a number of obstacles that could disrupt this timetable.
Chief among them is an unresolved debt dispute with Britain and the Netherlands arising from the 2008 collapse of the Icelandic banking sector, which hit British and Dutch investors hard.
The debt issue has in its turn led many Icelanders to question whether EU membership is such a good idea after all, and an opinion poll conducted shortly before formal accession talks began in July 2010 showed that a majority was in favour of withdrawing the country's application.
Other areas that have the capacity to derail the negotiations are Iceland's whale hunting industry and its insistence on maintaining its fishing limits - an issue that precipitated the ""Cod Wars"" of the 1950s and 1970s.

For centuries British dominion in Ireland gave rise to unrest which finally erupted into violence with the Easter Rising of 1916, when independence was proclaimed. The rising was crushed and many of its leaders executed, but the campaign for independence carried on through a bloody Anglo-Irish War of 1919-1921.

It was in 1922 that 26 counties of Ireland gained independence from London following negotiations which led to the other six counties, part of the province of Ulster, remaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Partition was followed by a year of civil war.
Relations between Dublin and London remained strained for many years afterwards. Northern Ireland saw decades of violent conflict between those campaigning for a united Ireland and those wishing to stay in the United Kingdom.
In an unprecedented and concerted effort to resolve the situation, the Irish and UK governments worked closely together in negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement on the future of Northern Ireland in 1998.
A booming economy transformed Dublin in the 1990s
Boom to bust
Ireland's economy began to grow rapidly in the 1990s, fuelled by foreign investment. This attracted a wave of incomers to a country where, traditionally, mass emigration had been the norm.
The boom that earned Ireland the nickname of ""Celtic Tiger"" faltered when the country fell into recession in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008.
The property boom had been fuelled by massive lending from the banks, and when this collapsed - and lenders were unable to repay - the Irish banking system was plunged into crisis.
The Irish economy underwent one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, with its economy shrinking by 10% in 2009.
In November 2010, Ireland and the EU agreed a financial rescue package for the republic worth tens of billions of euros, ending weeks of speculation about a bail-out.

250;"Giorgio Napolitano, veteran politician, was sworn in as Italy's 11th post-war president in May 2006.
Giorgio Napolitano
The former member of the Italian Communist Party was among the leading architects of the party's transformation into a social-democratic movement.
The Italian president heads the armed forces and has powers to veto legislation, disband parliament and call elections.
He played a key role in a fierce right-to-die debate in 2009 by refusing to sign an emergency government decree ordering doctors to resume feeding a woman who had been in a coma for 17 years.
Prime minister: Silvio Berlusconi
Silvio Berlusconi began his third term as prime minister of Italy in May 2008, heading a centre-right coalition including his own Forza Italia party.
The dominant figure on the right since 1994, when he first moved directly into politics, Mr Berlusconi built a business empire out of construction and media interests in his native Milan.
Three-times premier Silvio Berlusconi
He is one of Italy's wealthiest men, and owns three of the country's seven television channels and several leading newspapers. He also has interests in banking and insurance, and owns the AC Milan football team.
Mr Berlusconi launched his political career during the corruption inquiries of 1994, which paralysed the established parties.
His brand of populism and can-do image, heavily promoted through his media empire, made his new Forza Italia (""Let's go, Italy!"") party the largest in the new parliament, and he headed a fractious right-wing coalition that fell after a few months.
He used the period in opposition to reorganise Forza Italia along more traditional party lines, and won the 2001 elections at the head of a broader centre-right coalition with a commitment to simplify the tax system and halve unemployment.
The government was not able to meet its economic targets, and narrowly lost power in 2006.
His business contacts and media role have led to accusations of conflict of interest, especially over legislation seen as protecting his commercial interests. Mr Berlusconi has been put on trial at least six times over financial matters. Although found guilty on three occasions, he was later acquitted or benefited from the expiry of the statute of limitations.
His legal troubles took a surprise turn in October 2009 when the constitutional court overturned a law granting him immunity while in office. The ruling meant he could face trial in at least two court cases, including one accusing him of corruption. The law was pushed through by Berlusconi's coalition in 2008 when he faced separate trials in Milan for corruption and tax fraud tied to his Mediaset broadcasting empire.
The proceedings against Mr Berlusconi, who denies all charges, were suspended as a result of the law, drawing accusations that it was tailor-made for him.
The financial crisis of 2008 led to a boost in Mr Berlusconi's popularity ratings. He took steps to inject money into troubled banks and high-profile businesses and his ability to rule by decree when necessary seems to have reassured at least some voters.
In 2009, Mr Berlusconi came under pressure from the centre-left opposition over a series of allegations about his sex life, including allegedly spending a night with an escort and the publication of pictures of topless women at his residence.
His coalition lost its majority in the lower house of parliament in August 2010, when more than 30 deputies led by his long-time ally, Gianfranco Fini broke away from his Party of Freedom. Mr Fini had repeatedly voiced concern about the rule of law in Italy.
In March, his wife of 19 years, Veronica Lario, said she would file for divorce, accusing him of ""consorting with minors"" after he attended a female friend's 18th birthday party. He says all the allegations are wrong or exaggerated.
An assault at a political rally in Milan in December 2009 capped a difficult year for Mr Berlusconi. A man with a history of mental illness threw a model of Milan cathedral at the premier's face, breaking his nose and two teeth. Mr Berlusconi was hospitalised and returned to official duties a month after the attack.

An orthopedic surgeon who took part in clearing up the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, Valdis Zatlers was born in 1955 and became active in the pro-independence Popular Front under Soviet rule in 1988.
He later scaled down his political activity to concentrate on medical work. Parliament elected him president on the nomination of the centre-right governing coalition in 2007.
Prime minister: Valdis Dombrovskis
Valdis Dombrovskis became prime minister in March 2009 after the previous coalition government of Ivars Godmanis collapsed amid widespread discontent at its handling of the economic crisis.
Mr Dombrovskis has pushed through some tough spending cuts
Mr Dombrovskis' centre-right coalition was re-elected comfortably in elections in October 2010, regaining the parliamentary majority it had lost in March when the then largest party in his cabinet quit over a dispute about austerity measures.
A month after the elections, Mr Dombrovskis formed a government with the second-largest coalition partner, the Union of Farmers and Greens.
The prime minister's initial five-party coalition had included some parties from the Godmanis government plus a smaller centre-right party, the Civic Union.
During his first term in office, Mr Dombrovskis pushed through some of the toughest austerity measures in Europe in an effort to rescue the state from bankruptcy and prepare Latvia to join the euro by 2014.
The deep public spending cuts gave rise to widespread anger at home, but the government's policies impressed international lenders - especially the IMF and the EU, which in 2009 agreed a 7.5bn euro ($10bn) bailout for the country.
Investors see Mr Dombrovskis as the main guarantor of the rescue loans agreed, and the outcome of the October 2010 election suggests that he has has also succeeded in convincing the Latvian people that his policies represent the best chance for financial stability.
Born in 1971 and a physicist by training, he was an MP and finance minister in 2002-2004. From 2004 to 2009 he was a member of the European Parliament.

252;"This status came under the spotlight in 2000 when two international reports criticised Liechtenstein for lax financial controls. The reports said that the Liechtenstein banking system enabled gangs from Russia, Italy and Colombia to launder money from their criminal activities.
Alpine slopes cover two-thirds of the territory
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began to take a close interest in Liechtenstein's financial regulations - a process that received a further impetus when the international recession took hold in 2008.
Governments affected by plummeting tax incomes became determined to flush out assets hidden in tax havens, and Liechtenstein came under considerable pressure to apply greater banking transparency.
Stung by the criticism, Liechtenstein gradually reformed some of its laws. It reached tax agreements with several countries - including Germany, the UK and the US - aimed at encouraging citizens of those countries to come clean about any assets they might have in Liechtenstein's banks.
Liechtenstein remained neutral in World War II. A report commissioned by the government in 2001 after allegations that the country's banks had had dealings with the Nazis found that the banks' actions had been above board. It also found that slave labour from Nazi concentration camps had been used on Crown estates in Austria, but described the principality as a bystander rather than a perpetrator.
The country has come through a lengthy political wrangle over the role and power of the hereditary monarchy.
After a campaign which was at times bitterly divisive the people voted in March 2003 in a constitutional referendum to give Prince Hans-Adam sweeping new political powers. The outcome was decisive with just over 64% in favour of the changes.
In effect, the referendum made Liechtenstein Europe's only absolute monarchy. It gave Prince Hans-Adam the power to hire and fire the government, despite publicly-expressed fears that the development could usher in dictatorship.
The Roman Catholic church has traditionally had a strong role in Liechtenstein. Women faced a year in jail for having abortions until new legislation legalised it in late 2005. A bid by pro-life activists to stop the legislation from being passed failed when voters strongly rejected their proposals in a referendum.

Dalia Grybauskaite was voted in as Lithuania's first woman president with an emphatic election victory in May 2009.
Ms Grybauskaite cites Margaret Thatcher as an inspiration
She won 69% of the vote, against 11% for her closest rival, Algirdas Butkevicius of the opposition Social Democratic Party.
Previously the European Union budget commissioner, she stood as an independent, but with backing from the four-party centre-right coalition of Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius.
A former finance minister, Ms Grybauskaite's reputation for plain speaking helped win over an electorate nervous about the severe economic downturn that hit Lithuania in 2008.
She is sometimes dubbed ""Iron Lady"", the nickname of former British PM Margaret Thatcher, a steely reforming conservative she describes as one of her political models.
Ms Grybauskaite has said that her decision to stand came after anger at the economic slump boiled over in a riot in front of the parliament building in Vilnius in January 2009.
She declared herself broadly in support of the governing centre-right's response to the crisis, but criticised some of its tax increases and called on some ministers to ""correct mistakes of the past or go"".
Born in 1956 in Vilnius - then still part of the Soviet Union - Ms Grybauskaite studied in the Russian city of Leningrad - today's St Petersburg.
A senior civil servant since Lithuania's independence in 1990, she served as finance minister from 2001 to 2004, when the country nominated her the European Commission after joining the EU that year.
Prime minister: Andrius Kubilius
Andrius Kubilius is leader of the conservative Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats group, and served once as prime minister in 1999-2000.

His coalition government with three smaller centre-right parties won parliamentary approval in December. Together they hold 80 seats in Lithuania's 141-member parliament.
Mr Kubilius has said his priority is to tackle Lithuania's economic downturn.
A physicist by training, he entered parliament in 1992 after involvement in the pro-independence Sajudis movement. He joined the Homeland Union the following year.

After renewed occupation in World War II, Luxembourg abandoned its neutrality and became a front-rank enthusiast for international co-operation.
Luxembourg became a founder member of a customs union with Belgium and the Netherlands in 1948, and of the European Economic Community, a forerunner of the European Union, in 1957. Around one-third of Luxembourg's population are foreigners.
Luxembourg's prosperity was formerly based on steel manufacturing. With the decline of that industry, Luxembourg diversified and is now best known for its status as Europe's most powerful investment management centre.
But the country's strict laws on banking secrecy produced a system that was open to exploitation for the purposes of tax evasion and fraud.
Concern over Luxembourg's reputation as a tax haven - especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis - prompted the G20 group of countries to add it to a ""grey list"" of nations with questionable banking arrangements in April 2009.
Luxembourg responded by taking steps to improve the transparency of its financial arrangements. By July 2009 it had signed agreements on the exchange of tax information with a dozen countries, and was commended by the OECD for its prompt efforts to implement the internationally agreed standard.
Constitutional reform
Luxembourg's politics are characterised by stability and long-serving administrations.
This tranquillity was interrupted in 2008, when Grand Duke Henri said his conscience would not allow him to sign into law a bill approving euthanasia.
The crisis was resolved by a constitutional reform which removed the need for laws to be approved by the monarch, reducing the post to a largely ceremonial role.

Nikola Gruevski, leader of the centre-right VMRO-DPMNE, was first asked to form a government after elections in July 2006. The outgoing coalition was led by the Social Democrats.
The 2006 poll was seen as a test of the Ohrid peace deal that ended an ethnic Albanian uprising in 2001, and there was relief when it passed off relatively peacefully.
The prime minister's party won 44 seats in the 120-seat parliament and went on to gain a majority in parliament through a deal with the Democratic Party of Albanians and three small parties.
Mr Gruevski called fresh elections in 2008 after Macedonia's Nato entry was blocked by Greece. His party won the elections comfortably, though complaints of irregularities led to re-runs in ethnic Albanian areas.
His main priorities have been tackling corruption and organised crime and fostering economic revival and job creation. He is keen to see Macedonia join the EU as soon as possible.

The industrialised territory to the east of the Dniester, generally known as Trans-Dniester or the Dniester region, was formally an autonomous area within Ukraine before 1940 when the Soviet Union combined it with Bessarabia to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.
This area is mainly inhabited by Russian and Ukrainian speakers. As people there became increasingly alarmed at the prospect of closer ties with Romania in the tumultuous twilight years of the Soviet Union, Trans-Dniester unilaterally declared independence from Moldova in 1990.
There was fierce fighting there as it tried to assert this independence following the collapse of the USSR and the declaration of Moldovan sovereignty. Hundreds died. The violence ended with the introduction of Russian peacekeepers. Trans-Dniester's independence has never been recognised and the region has existed in a state of lawless and corrupt limbo ever since.
The region reasserted its demand for independence and also expressed support for a plan ultimately to join Russia in a September 2006 referendum which was unrecognised by Chisinau and the international community.
It still houses a stockpile of old Soviet military equipment and a contingent of troops of the Russian 14th army. Withdrawal began under international agreements in 2001 but was halted when the Trans-Dniester authorities blocked the dispatch of weapons. Subsequent agreements to resume did not reach fruition as relations between Moscow and Chisinau cooled.
The Moldovan parliament granted autonomous status to the Turkic-language speaking Gagauz region in the southwest of the republic in late 1994. It has powers over its own political, economic and cultural affairs.
Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe and has a large foreign debt and high unemployment. Its once-flourishing wine trade has been in decline and it is heavily dependent on Russia for energy supplies.
The Russian gas supplier Gazprom cut the gas supply off at the beginning of 2006 when Moldova refused to pay twice the previous price. A temporary compromise arrangement was reached soon afterwards and the two sides agreed a new price in July 2006 with a further rise in 2007.
Gas supplies were cut off again for several weeks in January 2009, this time as a result of a dispute over prices between supplier Russia and transit country Ukraine.

The EU-brokered deal forming it was intended to stabilise the region by settling Montenegrin demands for independence from Serbia and preventing further changes to Balkan borders.
The same deal also contained the seeds of the union's dissolution. It stipulated that after three years the two republics could hold referendums on whether to keep or scrap it. Montenegro opted for the latter.
A narrow majority voted to dissolve the union with Serbia
Montenegro last experienced independence nearly 90 years earlier. It was absorbed into the newly-formed Yugoslavia at the end of World War I.
There were fears that the 2006 independence vote could lead to unrest in the areas of Montenegro where ethnic Serbs, who make up roughly a third of the population, formed the majority and strongly opposed separation from Serbia. There was backing for independence from most ethnic Montenegrins and ethnic Albanians living in Montenegro.
The pro-independence camp led by Prime Minister Djukanovic argued that the association with Serbia was holding the republic back, not least with its bid for EU membership.
As the successor state to the union, Serbia inherited its seat at the UN and other international organisations. The newly-independent Montenegro has since been admitted to the UN in its own right.
The country officially applied to join the EU on 15 December 2008.
Another important milestone on Montenegro's path to EU membership was reached towards the end of 2009, when Montenegrin citizens were granted the right to visa-free travel within the Schengen zone.
Montenegro, which means ""Black Mountain"", borders Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo and Albania. About half of it is covered in thick forest.

After a longstanding policy of neutrality between Europe's great powers, the bitter experience of invasion and occupation during World War II led the Netherlands to become a leading supporter of international cooperation.

It is one of the world's most densely populated nations. As in many European countries, over-65s make up an increasing percentage of that population, leading to greater demands on the welfare system.
After two decades of strong growth and low unemployment, the economy ran into more troubled waters as global trade, in which the Netherlands is a major player, slowed in the early years of the new millennium.
There was concern that Dutch society's longstanding tradition of tolerance was under threat when homosexual anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn was assassinated in 2002.
Anxiety over increased racial tension has intensified further since the murder in 2004 of Theo Van Gogh who had made a controversial film on the position of women in Islamic society. A violent extremist later confessed and was jailed for life.
After Mr Van Gogh's killing, the government hardened its line on immigration and failed asylum seekers.

Norway declared its independence in 1905 when the union with Sweden was dissolved. Norway's people value their independence and prosperity highly. The Norwegians rejected membership of the then European Economic Community in 1972, and of the European Union in 1994, despite being urged by their governments to vote ""yes"".
In recent decades, Norway has forged a stronger role for itself in international politics. It has mediated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and from 2000 to 2009 was the chief mediator in the conflict between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil separatists.

Norway has a rich, sea-faring tradition and its lengthy, rugged coastline has been central to its development. More than a thousand years ago, Viking raids on the coasts of Britain and France were commonplace. The Vikings also mounted expeditions to the coast of North America.
Later, the Norwegians began to trade. Originally, the coastal waters provided fish for export. Today, Norway is among the world's largest exporters of fuels and fuel products.
Norway registered objections to the 1986 International Whaling Commission (IWC) ban on whaling and resumed the practice on a commercial basis in 1993. It argues that whaling is no more cruel than fishing and that stocks are sufficient to allow it to continue. Conservationists disagree.

Poland still has a huge farming sector which is unwieldy and very inefficient. Poverty is particularly widespread in rural areas.
Warsaw's profile on the international stage was raised by its support for the US-led military campaign in Iraq. A Polish-led international force, including 2,500 Polish troops, took on peacekeeping responsibilities in south-central Iraq in September 2003.

263;"President: Anibal Cavaco Silva
Anibal Cavaco Silvo: Former centre-right PM, now president
Anibal Cavaco Silva won the January 2006 presidential poll, becoming the first centre-right president since the coup of 1974. He defeated two Socialist candidates to win a first round election victory.
The president's role is mainly ceremonial, but incumbents can appoint prime ministers, dissolve parliament and call elections.
Prime minister: Jose Socrates
Jose Socrates, whose governing Socialist Party came to power in 2005, led his party to another election victory in September 2009.
Jose Socrates formed his second government in 2009
The party, however, lost its overall majority. Final results from the general election gave the Socialists 36% the vote, seven points ahead of the centre-right Social Democrats.
Following talks with other political parties, Mr Socrates decided in October to form a minority government and to negotiate support for changes in legislation on a case-by-case basis.
Ruling in a minority is likely to present a tough challenge, as Portugal needs to swiftly address problems such as rising debt and unemployment, a growing budget deficit and a widening wealth gap with its European partners.
In the 2005 elections, the Socialists gained their first absolute majority in parliament since democracy returned to Portugal in 1974.
On taking office then, Mr Socrates - who had led the Socialists since 2004 - said his priority would be to revive the economy and stem rising unemployment.
His first government sharply cut spending, by reducing pensions, raising the retirement age and withdrawing civil service benefits in an attempt to reduce one of Europe's biggest budget deficits.
The reforms - which some said were destroying social rights - prompted repeated protests mostly among public sector workers.
Despite the tough economic medicine administered by Mr Socrates during his first term in office, Portugal is still Western Europe's poorest country.
Even more pain looked likely after the financial crisis of 2008/9, as Portugal's budget deficit reached 8.3% - well over the 3% allowed under euro membership rules. In March 2010, Mr Socrates's government introduced a package of spending cuts and tax increases on the rich in an attempt to rein in the deficit.

264;"President: Traian Basescu
Traian Basescu, a former sea captain and mayor of Bucharest, first became president following elections in 2004.
President Basescu has pursued a pro-reform course
He gained a second endorsement from the electorate in a May 2007 referendum when they rejected an attempt by parliament to impeach him. MPs had decided by a large majority to remove him from office, accusing him of exceeding his constitutional powers.
The attempt to impeach the president followed tension between him and the government of then Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu over the pace of reforms.
Mr Basescu won the December 2009 presidential election by a very narrow majority over the opposition Social Democrats' Mircea Geoana.
Since he came to power, Mr Basescu has drawn international praise for his anti-corruption efforts and for preparing Romania to join the EU.
In 2005 Mr Basescu started the process of opening the files of the feared communist-era secret police - the Securitate. Researchers cleared him of accusations that he collaborated with the Securitate.
Mr Basescu was 53 at the time of his election. He was transport minister between 1996 and 2000.
His predecessor, Ion Iliescu, had dominated Romanian politics since the fall of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. Under his Social Democrats, Romania entered Nato and moved towards EU membership.
Prime minister: Emil Boc
Parliament first approved the appointment of Democratic Liberal Party leader Emil Boc as prime minister on 22 December 2008.
Mr Boc has pledged tough action to stave off financial crisis
However, only 10 months later, his government lost a confidence vote in parliament, with MPs accusing it of failing to improve the country's recession-hit economy.
Parliament subsequently rejected President Basescu's nominee to succeed Mr Boc, Lucian Croitoru, and Mr Boc carried on in a caretaker capacity until presidential elections in November and December 2009.
After Mr Basescu was re-elected as president, he nominated Mr Boc to lead a new government, which was duly approved by parliament on 23 December 2009.
The new centrist government - a coalition made up of the Democratic Liberal Party, an ethnic Hungarian party and several independent allies - immediately unveiled an austerity budget for 2010, and promised tough action to tackle the continuing financial crisis.
Analysts say Mr Boc faces one of the toughest jobs in Romania's post-Communist history in winning acceptance for the belt-tightening measures needed in order to meet the International Monetary Fund's demands and unfreeze tranches of a 20bn euro aid package, which are vital to prevent Romania from plunging deeper into recession.
Government proposals to tackle the budget deficit by cutting public-sector wages and pensions triggered mass protests in Bucharest in May 2010.
Mr Boc's political career has been closely associated with that of Mr Basescu, who nominated him as executive president of the Democratic Party in 2003.
The Democratic Party later merged with the Liberal Democrats to form the Democratic Liberal Party.
A member of parliament in 2000-2004, Mr Boc rose to prominence in 2004 when he beat veteran nationalist Gheorghe Funar to become mayor of Cluj-Napoca, the main city of his native Transylvania. He was re-elected with 76% of the vote in 2008.
An academic specializing in political science and law, Mr Boc was born in 1966 and is married with two daughters.

In the period of rapid privatisation in the early 1990s, the government of President Boris Yeltsin created a small but powerful group of magnates, often referred to as ""oligarchs"", who acquired vast interests in the energy and media sectors.

Russia resurgent
During Mr Putin's presidency Russia's booming economy and assertive foreign policy bolstered national pride. In particular, Russia promoted its perceived interests in former Soviet states more openly, even at the cost of antagonising the West.
St Petersburg's State Hermitage houses a vast art collection
The tensest moment came in August 2008, when a protracted row over two breakaway regions of Georgia escalated into a military conflict between Russia and Georgia.
Russia sent troops into Georgia and declared that it was recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, sparking angry reactions in the West and fears of a new Cold War.
At the same time, Moscow threatened to counter plans by the US Bush administration to develop an anti-missile system in Eastern Europe with its own missiles in Kaliningrad Region on Poland's borders. President Obama later withdrew the plan, in a move seen in Russian official circles as a vindication of the assertive foreign policy.
Another source of irritation between Russia and the US is Moscow's role in Iran's nuclear energy programme. Russia agreed in 2005 to supply fuel for Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor and has been reluctant to support the imposition of UN sanctions on Iran.
A gradual warming in relations between Russia and the US early in 2010 culminated in the signing of a new nuclear arms treaty designed to replace the expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) of 1991.
Though disagreements remain between Moscow and Washington over US plans for a missile defence shield, there are signs that the thaw in relations could extend to a greater willingness on the part of Russia to apply pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme.
Economic muscle
The annual Victory Day parade marks the end of World War II
Russia's economic power lies in its key natural resources - oil and gas. The energy giant Gazprom is close to the Russian state and critics say it is little more than an economic and political tool of the Kremlin.
At a time of increased concern over energy security, Moscow has more than once reminded the rest of the world of the power it wields as a major energy supplier. In 2006, it cut gas to Ukraine after a row between the countries, a move that also affected the supply of gas to Western Europe
Ethnic and religious divisions
While Russians make up more than 80% of the population and Orthodox Christianity is the main religion, there are many other ethnic and religious groups. Muslims are concentrated among the Volga Tatars and the Bashkirs and in the North Caucasus.
Separatists and latterly armed Islamists have made the Caucasus region of Chechnya a war zone for much of the post-Soviet era. Many thousands have died since Russian troops were first sent to put down a separatist rebellion in 1994.
Moscow is convinced that any loosening of its grip on Chechnya would result in the whole of the North Caucasus falling to anarchy or Islamic militancy.
Human rights groups at home and abroad have accused Russian forces in Chechnya of widespread abuses against the public. Since the 11 September attacks on the US Moscow has tried to present its campaign as part of the global war against terrorism.
In a sign of growing confidence that peace might be returning, the Russian authorities called a formal end to the military operation against the rebels in 2009. Sporadic violence continues, however, with a major suicide bomb blast in September 2010 reigniting the debate about the efficacy of the counter-terror campaign.

267;"Serbia inherits membership of the United Nations and other international institutions.
Serbia's parliament meets in central Belgrade
Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics still left in the old Yugoslav federation, had agreed in 2002 to scrap remnants of the ex-communist state and create the new, looser Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
The EU-brokered deal under which the union came into being in 2003 was intended to stabilise the region by settling Montenegrin demands for independence and preventing further changes to Balkan borders.
The same agreement also contained the seeds of the Union's dissolution. It stipulated that after three years the two republics could hold referendums on whether to keep or scrap it. Montenegro duly voted for independence in a referendum in May 2006.
The two republics had been united in one form or another for nearly 90 years. With separation from Montenegro, Serbia is cut off from the Adriatic Sea and becomes landlocked.
Yugoslav era
The end of the Union of Serbia and Montenegro marked the closing chapter in the history of the separation of the six republics of the old Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia which was proclaimed in 1945 and comprised Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia.
Under Yugoslavia's authoritarian communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, the lid was kept on ethnic tensions. The federation lasted for over 10 years after his death in 1980 but under Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic it fell apart through the 1990s.
The secession of Slovenia and Macedonia came relatively peacefully but there were devastating wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia and Montenegro together formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003.
Kosovo
In 1998 violence flared in the autonomous province of Kosovo in Serbia. The Kosovo Liberation Army, supported by the majority ethnic Albanians, came out in open rebellion against Serbian rule. International pressure on Milosevic grew amid the escalating violence.
Nato launched air strikes in Kosovo and Serbia in March 1999. An exodus of ethnic Albanians to neighbouring countries gathered pace. The UN took over administration of the region after Serbian forces had been driven out.
Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008 after the failure of UN-brokered talks on the status of the province. Serbia said the declaration was illegal, and other countries are divided as to whether to recognise it.
Road to Europe
In late 2005, the EU began talks with Belgrade on the possibility of reaching a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. These were called off some months later because of the continuing failure of the Serbian authorities to arrest several war crimes suspects.
One of the most notorious of these, the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was arrested in Belgrade in July 2008 by Serbian security forces and extradited to The Hague, weeks after a pro-Western government took office. European foreign ministers praised the arrest as a significant step for Serbia in its efforts to join the EU.
In December 2009 Serbia formally submitted its application to join the EU, though membership negotiations cannot begin in earnest until two war crimes suspects still at large - including the former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic - have been captured.
Relations with Russia
Though the current Serbian government is pro-Western and sees eventual membership of the EU as being in the country's best interests, Serbia is traditionally an ally of Russia, which supported its opposition to Kosovo's independence.
In 2008, Serbia-Russia ties were further strengthened by the signing of a major energy deal, and in October 2009 Russia granted Serbia a 1bn euro (£0.9bn) loan to help it cover its budget deficit after the economy was hit hard by the global downturn.

Ivan Gasparovic defeated former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in the second round of the presidential elections in April 2004 on the eve of EU entry.
During his election campaign he supported EU accession but criticised the minority government's EU-oriented economic reforms.
In April 2009 Mr Gasparovic became the first president of Slovakia to win re-election, when he defeated his centre-right challenger, Iveta Radicova, in the second round of voting by more than ten percentage points. He received more than 55% of the vote.
The president appoints the prime minister. However, parliament exercises legislative power.
Prime minister: Iveta Radicova
Iveta Radicova became Slovakia's first female prime minister following elections in June 2010. She was appointed to head a four-party centre-right government, replacing a centre-left coalition led by Robert Fico.
Ms Radicova aims to repair Slovakia's battered public finances
The former sociologist made restoring the country's public finances, under strain as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, her government's main priority.
She also promised to return Slovakia to the high growth rates it enjoyed in the years before the crisis.
Her style is seen as one of listening and persuasion rather than confrontation - a trait said to derive from her experience as a social worker with Slovakia's disadvantaged Roma minority and the handicapped.
Along with Ms Radicova's conservative Slovakian Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU) party, her coalition includes the liberal Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) party, the mostly ethnic Hungarian Most-Hid and the Christian Democrat Movement (KDH).
Together, four parties won a majority in parliament, even though the centre-left Smer party of incumbent PM Fico emerged as the largest grouping.
Born in Bratislava in 1956, Ms Radicova graduated in sociology, going on to become a lecturer in the field.
She entered politics in 2005 as labour, social affairs and family minister in the centre-right government of Mikulas Dzurinda, Robert Fico's predecessor as PM.
Elected to parliament for the SDKU in 2006, Ms Radicova resigned from the role after voting for an absent colleague in parliament. In 2009, she stood for the presidency, losing to Ivan Gasparovic in the second-round run-off.
Mr Dzurinda's government oversaw Slovakia's entry into the EU and Nato, but its economic reforms made it unpopular with voters, and it was replaced by Mr Fico's centre-left coalition after elections in 2006.
Mr Fico made strengthening social welfare measures his main priority, reversing some of the Dzurinda cabinet's policies.

The move was undoubtedly aided by Western European recognition of the Slovenes' aspirations and the low proportion of other ethnic groups in the country.

Slovenia has always been the most prosperous region of the former Yugoslavia and has found the transition from a socialist economy to the capitalist free market easier than most.
On 1 January 2007, it became the first of the new EU member states to join the eurozone. A year later, it became the first former communist state to take on the EU presidency.
Politically, Slovenia was the most liberal republic within Yugoslavia. Throughout the 1980s there was pressure from Slovenia for greater political freedom and pluralism in the federation.
This reputation was tarnished after independence when thousands of nationals of other former Yugoslav republics were removed from population records and lost residency rights.
Parliament later passed a bill restoring their citizenship but a referendum held shortly before EU entry in 2004 overturned it by an overwhelming margin. Human rights groups expressed dismay at the move which embarrassed the leadership as it prepared to celebrate EU membership.
Slovenia's relations with Croatia have long been strained on account of a rumbling dispute over sea and land borders dating back to the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Ljubljana dropped its opposition to Zagreb's entry into NATO in March 2009, but continued to block Croatia's EU membership bid for a further eight months, only agreeing to lift the embargo after a deal had been signed on the Piran border dispute in November 2009.
The centre-right opposition demanded a referendum on the border deal, which the public narrowly approved in a June 2010 plebiscite.

The level of autonomy afforded to each region is far from uniform. For example, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia have special status with their own language and other rights.
Andalucia, Navarre, Valencia and the Canaries in turn have more extensive powers than some other regions. Asturias and Aragon have taken steps to consolidate language rights.

In 2006 a Catalan referendum backed by the central government gave the region greater autonomy.
The Catalans won nation status within Spain and the region's parliament gained extra powers in taxation and judicial matters. The country's regional picture is a complex and evolving one.
One of Spain's most serious domestic issues has been tension in the northern Basque region. A violent campaign by the Basque separatist group ETA has led to nearly 850 deaths over the past four decades.
Eta declared a ceasefire in March 2006 saying it wished to see the start of a democratic process for the Basque region. The move divided opinion in Spain.
Tentative moves to negotiate a lasting peace were dealt a blow when Eta carried out a deadly bomb attack at Madrid's international airport at the end of the year. In June 2007, Eta called off its ceasefire.
The group announced another ceasefire in September 2010, but this time, the government said it was not prepared to enter into negotiations unless Eta renounced violence for good.
Until 2008, the Spanish economy was regarded as one of the most dynamic within the EU. However, the mainstays of the economy were tourism and a booming housing market and construction industry, and so the global economic crisis of 2008-9 hit the country hard.
Spain was tipped into a severe recession and by mid-2010 unemployment had climbed to over 20% - double the EU average.

However, his Alliance for Sweden fell short of an overall majority by two seats, and Mr Reinfeldt formed a minority coalition government. The anti-immigration Swedish Democrats became Sweden's first far right party to win seats in parliament.
The opposition centre-left Social Democrats, who governed Sweden for much of the period since World War II, suffered a painful slump in support.
After becoming party leader of the right-wing Moderate Party in 2003, Mr Reinfeldt moved it towards the political centre, toning down its criticism of Sweden's welfare state and adopting a consensual approach. He supports Sweden's entry into Nato, provided there is cross-party support.

Federal President (rotating): Doris Leuthard (until 1 Jan 2011)
Switzerland is unusual in having a collective head of state, the seven-member Federal Council, which doubles up as the country's cabinet.
The council was set up by the constitution of 1848, which is still in force today.
Doris Leuthard - president for 2010
Members are elected for four-year terms by a joint session of both houses of parliament, although in practice changes in membership are rare, making the Federal Council one of the world's most stable governments.
The election of a new female minister to the Federal Council in September 2010 gave the cabinet a majority of women for the first time in the country's history.
Each year, by tradition, a different member of the council fills the largely ceremonial post of Federal President on a rotating basis. The office does not confer the status of head of state, which is held jointly by all the councillors.
For decades, the Federal Council was made up by a grand coalition of all the main parties in parliament, in an effort to ensure stability and promote consensus.
From 1959, membership was apportioned in accordance to a fixed formula which gave the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) two seats, the centre-left Social Democrats (SP) two, the centre-right Christian Democrats (CVP) two and the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) one, regardless of any changes in their share of MPs.
This ""magic formula"" was amended in 2003, when the anti-EU Swiss People's Party overtook the Free Democrats and Social Democrats to become the most popular party, and was given a second post, at the expense of the waning Christian Democrats.
The party further boosted its standing as the biggest group in parliament in the October 2007 elections, after a controversial campaign calling for the extradition of foreigners who commit serious crimes.
However, in December 2007, the party ended decades of consensus politics when it suspended its two councillors and declared itself in opposition.
The move was a response to parliament's refusal to re-elect the party's controversial leader Christoph Blocher to the council over its anti-immigration election campaign.
But the Swiss People's Party regained a seat on the council with the close-run election of Ueli Maurer in December 2008. Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, one of the two councillors expelled from the SVP in 2007, is still in office, but as a member of a new moderate breakaway group, the Conservative Democratic Party (BDP).

Turkey's progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting in the decades following the death of President Ataturk in 1938. The army saw itself as the guarantor of the constitution, and ousted governments on a number of occasions when it thought they were challenging secular values.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
Efforts to reduce state control over the economy also faced many obstacles. After years of mounting difficulties which brought the country close to economic collapse, a tough recovery programme was agreed with the IMF in 2002. Since then, Turkey has seen strong economic growth and a dramatic fall in inflation. However, huge foreign debt and unemployment remain major burdens.
Concerns over the potential for conflict between a secular establishment backed by the military and a traditional society deeply rooted in Islam resurfaced with the landslide election victory of the Islamist-based Justice and Development Party (AK) in 2002.
The secularist opposition has on several occasions since then challenged the constitutional right of the AK to be the party of government. In March 2008 the Constitutional Court narrowly rejected a petition by the chief prosecutor to ban the AK and 71 of its officials, including President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for allegedly seeking to establish an Islamic state.
In recent years there have been several allegations that members of the military - which has long seen itself as the guardian of the secular system - have been involved in plots to overthrow the government.
EU candidacy
Islam has made a comeback after decades of secularism
Turkey became an EU candidate country in 1999 and, in line with EU requirements, went on to introduce substantial human rights and economic reforms. The death penalty was abolished, tougher measures were brought in against torture and the penal code was overhauled.
Reforms were introduced in the areas of women's rights and Kurdish culture, language, education and broadcasting. Women's rights activists have said the reforms do not go far enough and have accused the government of lacking full commitment to equality and of acting only under EU pressure.
After intense bargaining, EU membership talks were launched in October 2005. Accession negotiations are expected to take about 10 years. So far, the going has not been easy.
Turkey has long been at odds with its close neighbour, Greece, over the divided island of Cyprus and territorial disputes in the Aegean.
The breakthrough in its EU membership talks came just weeks after Turkey agreed to recognise Cyprus as an EU member - though it qualified this conciliatory step by declaring that it was not tantamount to full diplomatic recognition.
The Kurdish issue
Turkey is home to a sizeable Kurdish minority, which by some estimates constitutes up to a fifth of the population. The Kurds have long complained that the Turkish government was trying to destroy their identity and that they suffer from economic disadvantage and human rights violations.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the best known and most radical of the Kurdish movements, launched a guerrilla campaign in 1984 for an ethnic homeland in the Kurdish heartland in the southeast. Thousands died and hundreds of thousands became refugees in the ensuing conflict with the PKK, which Turkey, the US and the European Union deem a terrorist organisation.
Kurdish guerrilla attacks briefly subsided after the 1999 capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, but soon began to increase again.
Partly in a bid to improve its chances of EU membership, the government began to ease restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language form 2003 onwards. As part of a new ""Kurdish initiative"" launched in 2009, it pledged to extend linguistic and cultural rights and to reduce the military presence in the mainly Kurdish southeast of the country.
Nonetheless fighting has continued. A PKK offer in July 2010 to consider a truce if the government were to extend Kurdish civil rights was met with an official refusal to respond to ""terrorist"" statements.

A significant minority of the population of Ukraine are Russians or use Russian as their first language. Russian influence is particularly strong in the industrialised east, as well as in Crimea, an autonomous republic on the Black Sea which was part of Russia until 1954. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is based there.
Crimea is also the homeland of the Crimean Tatars whom Stalin accused of collaborating with the Nazis and deported to Central Asia in 1944. More than 250,000 have returned since the late 1980s.
Remembering the millions who died in Ukraine's Stalin-era Great Famine
In 1932-1933 Stalin's programme of enforced agricultural collectivisation brought famine and death to millions in Ukraine, the bread basket of the USSR. Not until its twilight years did the Soviet Union acknowledge the extent of the suffering.
News of another Soviet-era calamity, the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, rang alarm bells around the world immediately. About 8% of Ukraine's territory was contaminated as were large areas in neighbouring Belarus. Millions have suffered as a result.
Independence
The first president after independence, former Communist Party official Leonid Kravchuk, presided over a period of economic decline and runaway inflation. His successor, Leonid Kuchma, oversaw steady economic recovery, but was accused of conceding too much to Russian economic interests.
Opposition to Mr Kuchma grew, further fed by discontent at controls on media freedom, manipulation of the political system and cronyism.
The authorities' attempt to rig the 2004 presidential elections led to the ""Orange Revolution"", with reference to the colour of the main opposition movement.
Orange Revolution
Mass protests, a revolt by state media against government controls and the fracturing of the governing coalition brought in European-Union mediation and a re-run of the election.
A fragile alliance of anti-Kuchma forces, from pro-Western democrats, socialists, business interests and nationalists united behind opposition leader and former prime minister Viktor Yushchenko, who won the presidency.
Mr Yushchenko secured the transparency of the democratic process, the rule of law and media freedom, but his efforts to move towards Nato and EU membership made slow progress in the face of Western reluctance to antagonise a resurgent Russia and a divided public opinion in Ukraine itself.
Rivalry with his prime minister, Yuliya Tymoshenko, soured into open antagonism, and neither proved able to cope with the worldwide economic downturn after 2008.
Although trade with EU countries now exceeds that with Russia, Moscow is the largest individual trading partner. Ukraine depends on Russia for its gas supplies and forms an important part of the pipeline transit route for Russian gas exports to Europe.
Gas disputes
A dispute over price rises prompted Russia briefly to cut supplies for use by Ukraine in January 2006 and raised concerns across Europe too. The gas was switched back on only after Ukraine agreed to pay almost twice the former price, which rose sharply again for 2007. In January 2009, Russia again cut gas supplies in a row over unpaid fees.
The Ukrainian economy's dependence on steel exports made it particularly vulnerable to the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008, and in October of that year the country was offered a $16.5bn (£10.4bn) loan by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Despite being a major member of the EU, the country is not part of the euro zone, and the question of whether it will join any time soon appears to have receded for the moment. The government has said a series of economic criteria must be met before the issue can be put to a referendum.
In recent years the UK has taken steps to devolve powers to Scotland and Wales. The Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh and the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff opened in 1999, and the possibility of devolution for the English regions has also been discussed.

In Northern Ireland, after decades of violent conflict, the Good Friday agreement of 1998 led to a new assembly with devolved powers, bringing hopes of lasting peace. The assembly was suspended in 2002 amid a row over alleged IRA activities. Its suspension was to last for three and a half years.
In a bid to restart the political process and after consultations with Dublin, the UK passed legislation paving the way for the recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2006.
But assembly leaders missed a November deadline to form a power-sharing executive. Assembly elections in the following March led to the eventual swearing-in of the leaders of the power-sharing government on 8 May 2007, ending five years of direct rule from London.
Diversity
The UK is ethnically diverse, partly as a legacy of empire. Lately, the country has been struggling with issues revolving around multiculturalism, immigration and national identity.
This is against a background of concerns about terrorism and political and religious radicalism, heightened after the suicide bomb attacks on London's transport network in 2005.
Some politicians and commentators say a stronger sense of shared British values is needed to foster integration within a mixed society. And while some advocate tough policies on limiting immigration, others attempt to put the case for it as a positive force.
One of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new EU member states in Eastern Europe.
Culture
The UK has been at the forefront of youth culture since the heyday of the Beatles and Rolling Stones in the 1960s.
It has a rich literary heritage encompassing the works of English writers such as William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, Scot Robert Burns, Welshman Dylan Thomas and Northern Irishman Seamus Heaney.
Traditional music has deep roots across the UK, which has also produced classical composers from Henry Purcell in the Baroque period to Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.

276;"Pope tells of youth under Nazis
Already one of the Vatican's most powerful men, he presided over the funeral of his predecessor Pope John Paul II and was said to be among the late pontiff's closest friends.
Pope Benedict was born in Bavaria in 1927 and is the oldest man to become pope in more than 100 years. He is the first German pope since the eleventh century.
Drafted into the German armed forces during World War II, he deserted as it drew to a close and was a prisoner of war in 1945. He has said that the brutality of the Nazis later helped lead him to the priesthood, and in one of his first papal addresses he condemned the Holocaust.
He became cardinal-archbishop of Munich in 1977, and in 1981 the new Pope John Paul II appointed him head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.
In this office, the successor to the historical Inquisition, Cardinal Ratzinger set out his conservative intellectual stance, including rigorously uncompromising views on birth control, sexuality and euthanasia.
Pope Benedict has not adapted to the public limelight as easily as his predecessor, and a number of controversies have resulted from his uncertain handling of the media.
His decision to readmit Richard Williamson, an ultraconservative bishop and Holocaust denier, to the Church angered Jews and many loyal Catholics, and his quotation of comments by a Byzantine emperor highly critical of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad provoked protests by Muslim clerics and public figures.
Both these controversies were eclipsed by the coming to light of numerous sex abuse scandals involving Catholic clergy throughout the world. The Vatican dismissed claims that the Holy See had attempted to hush up accusations of clerical paedophilia rather than take action to stop the abuse as an ""ignoble"" attack on the Pope.

277;"Abkhazia's long history was always closely intertwined with that of Georgia, although its language is unrelated, and is closer to several spoken in the North Caucasus.

De-facto independence recognised by Moscow but not internationally
Ceasefire in force, Russian peacekeepers in place
Georgia says Russian troops propping up separatist state
Georgian offer of autonomy within federal state rejected by Abkhazia
From the 9th century BC onwards, it was part of the Georgian-dominated kingdom of Colchis. The area adopted Christianity in the sixth century.
In the 8th century AD, Abkhazia became an independent state, before being united with the medieval kingdom of Georgia in 1008. In the 19th century, the wider region came under Russian domination, and in 1864 Abkhazia was annexed to the Russian Empire.
After the Bolshevik revolution, Abkhazia gained a measure of autonomy, before Stalin incorporated it into the Soviet union republic of Georgia in 1931.
Despite formally remaining an autonomous republic of the USSR, there was very little sign of genuine autonomy, and Abkhaz ethnic culture was suppressed in favour of Georgian. The policy of repression was eased soon after Stalin's death in 1953.
At the time of the collapse of the USSR in 1991, less than a fifth of the people of Abkhazia were ethnic Abkhaz, while the rest of the population was made up largely of Georgians.
When Georgia became independent, supporters of a break with Tbilisi in favour of independence and closer ties with Russia became more vociferous. Tension grew, and in 1992 Georgia sent troops to enforce the status quo.

In late 1993, they were driven out in fierce fighting. Several thousand people were killed, and nearly the entire Georgian-speaking population fled the republic in what Georgia describes as a campaign of ethnic cleansing.
Abkhazia formally declared independence in 1999, resulting in an international economic embargo that is still in force. It has left Abkhazia's economy highly dependent on Russia, which maintains a border crossing and railway line to Sukhumi.
Moscow infuriated Tbilisi by making it easy for people in Abkhazia to gain Russian citizenship, and most now hold Russian passports.
For nearly 15 years, UN peacekeepers - mainly composed of Russians - patrolled a buffer zone on the border between the two sides.
However, in August 2008, during the war between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia, Russian army troops moved through Abkhazia and pushed into Georgia proper, effectively using the region to open another front with Tbilisi.
Meanwhile, Abkhaz forces drove Georgian troops out of the only area of Abkhazia still under Tbilisi's control - the Kodori gorge.
After the 2008 conflict, Moscow declared that it would formally recognise the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. As of the end of 2009, only Nicaragua and Venezuela had followed suit.
In October 2008, Russia pulled its troops back to the Abkhaz-Georgian border, but stationed a large force in the breakaway republic, with the agreement of the Sukhumi government.
The next year, Moscow also vetoed an extension of the UN peacekeeping mission, and signed a five-year agreement with Abkhazia to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper.

The port in the capital, Batumi, is used for the shipment of oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Its oil refinery handles Caspian oil from Azerbaijan which arrives by pipeline to Supsa port and is transported from there to Batumi by rail.
Batumi is also an important gateway for the shipment of goods heading into Georgia, Azerbaijan and landlocked Armenia. The Ajarian capital is a centre for shipbuilding and manufacturing. Ajaria has good land for growing tea, citrus fruits and tobacco.
History
The people of Ajaria are ethnically Georgian and the region also has a substantial Russian-speaking population. Under Ottoman rule from the 17th until the 19th century Islam predominated. The word Ajarian came to mean a Georgian Muslim.
Tensions erupt on the internal border between Georgia and Ajaria
In 1878 Ajaria was annexed by Russia and, following the Bolshevik revolution, incorporated into Georgia as an autonomous republic within the USSR. Under Stalin, Islam, like Christianity, was ruthlessly repressed. Nowadays about half the population professes the Islamic faith.
Unlike the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Ajaria has been spared major violence and ethnic unrest since Georgia became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The region was led between 1991 and May 2004 by Aslan Abashidze, who maintained close ties with Moscow. Election results gave him at least 90% of the vote every time and he ruled in what many observers described as an autocratic style.
Aslan Abashidze ousted
Former Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze stepped down and fled
After Eduard Shevardnadze was overthrown as Georgian president and the results of the November 2003 Georgian parliamentary elections were annulled, a state of emergency was declared in Ajaria. Its leadership refused to recognise the full authority of Mikhail Saakashvili as Georgian president.
In May 2004, Mr Abashidze claimed that Georgian forces were preparing to invade. His forces blew up bridges connecting the region with the rest of Georgia. Mr Saakashvili ordered the Ajarian leader to comply with the Georgian constitution and start disarming or face removal.
Large numbers of demonstrators took to the streets of Batumi. In an echo of events in Tbilisi the previous autumn, Mr Abashidze resigned.
Russia then agreed to close its military base at Batumi in 2007. The base was a source of great tension between Moscow and Tbilisi.

Spain also controls a scattering of islets along the north African coast, including uninhabited Perejil, which was at the centre of a spat in 2002 when Moroccan soldiers occupied it before being removed by the Spanish army.
More recently, differences over Ceuta and Melilla have not prevented a warming of relations between Morocco and Spain, particularly economic ones. Morocco's premier has advocated ""neighbourly"" talks on the issue.
Ceuta, a stepping-stone to mainland Europe
With its rebuilt 15th century cathedral, shipyards and a fish-processing plant, Ceuta is viewed by Spain as the more strategically-valuable enclave. The town is a 90-minute ferry ride from mainland Spain.
Melilla, conquered in 1497, is a modern town with a distinctive old quarter.
The enclaves are surrounded by fences, intended to deter illegal immigrants. But Ceuta and Melilla are nonetheless used by many Africans as stepping-stones to Iberia. Many migrants are caught and some drown while attempting to make the sea crossing. People trafficking is common.
After a series of increasingly-desperate attempts by would-be immigrants to surmount the barriers in 2005, Spain and Morocco agreed to deploy extra troops to try to secure the borders.
Ceuta and Melilla are linked to Spain by ferry services to Malaga, Algeciras and Almeria. Borders and defence are controlled by Madrid. Tourism is an important money-earner with duty-free goods being a big draw for visitors.

The Channel Islands were owned by the Duchy of Normandy, and passed to the English Crown when William the Conqueror became King of England in 1066. While England lost mainland Normandy in 1204, the islands remained possessions of the Crown and were divided into the two bailiwicks later that century.
Corbiere lighthouse Jersey
Since then the bailiwicks have maintained separate institutions, laws and media, with the exception of a common independent TV station, Channel TV.
During the Second World War the islands were occupied by Germany, causing considerable suffering to the locals. Some were deported as slave labourers, Jews were sent to concentration camps, reprisals for partisan activities were harsh, and many were reduced to near starvation by the end of the war. Accusations of collaboration and cover-up poisoned relations between many islanders for decades.
The total population is about 160,000, of whom the overwhelming majority is made up of native islanders of Norman French and British extraction. There are also groups of European Union citizens, with a prominent community from Portugal.
As Crown Dependencies the islands are not part of the United Kingdom or European Union, nor are they colonies or overseas territories of the United Kingdom like Gibraltar. They are possessions of the British Crown with independent administrations. Their assemblies pass their own legislation with the assent of the Crown granted in the Privy Council.
The Crown is responsible for defence, diplomatic representation and citizenship, although the islands maintain their own controls over housing and employment that apply to British as well as other citizens.
The islands have the right to establish direct relations with foreign governments. Although not parts of the European Union, they are in a customs union with it.
The bailiwicks are governed by elected parliaments called States, while the smaller islands of Alderney and Sark also have their own assemblies - the States and Chief Pleas respectively.
The bailiffs are the chief civil officers, and preside over the States and court of law. They are appointed by the Crown, and usually serve until retirement or death. Their powers have been steadily transferred to the States over the last 100 years, culminating in the adoption of a ministerial system and appointment of chief ministers in 2005.
The economy of the islands is dominated by financial services, tourism, electronic commerce and agriculture. The relatively light tax burden has encouraged a booming offshore finance sector. Pressure from the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is obliging the islands to change their taxation systems for the sake of compliance, as with other offshore centres.

Chechnya has been a thorn in Russia's mountainous southern border for nearly two centuries. The Russians finally overcame the resistance of Imam Shamil in 1859, claiming the Caucasus region for the empire after a long and bloody campaign that caught the imagination of many 19th Century Russian writers from Lermontov to Tolstoy.
Thousands of Russian soldiers remain in Chechnya
The Chechens had to wait for more than 60 years before they briefly escaped Russian dominion again in the chaos following the October revolution.
However, that period of independence was short-lived and by 1922 the republic had been forced back into the Russian fold.
World War II and the Nazi invasion presented another glimpse of freedom from Moscow's rule. When the war ended, Stalin sought vengeance. He accused the Chechens of collaborating. Their punishment was mass deportation to Siberia and Central Asia. They were allowed to return only in 1957 when Khrushchev was in power in the Kremlin.
Post-Soviet years
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Dzhokhar Dudayev, a former senior officer in the Soviet air force, declared independence from Russia. Yeltsin responded by sending a few hundred Interior Ministry servicemen to the republic. They were met at the airport by Chechen fighters and sent back home on buses, the first in a series of humiliations for Moscow.
Moscow says the situation in Chechnya has now 'normalised'
This was followed by three years during which armed groups gained an increasing hold on Chechnya and Dudayev became more outspoken in his defiance of Moscow where the leadership argued over how to handle the situation.
In 1994 Russia sent its forces in a very poorly planned bid to bring the rebellious region back to heel. Early promises of a quick victory were soon silent as the Chechens put up fierce resistance to the Russian assault and the death toll mounted.
Amid growing public outcry over rising losses in the Russian army, Moscow withdrew its forces under a 1996 peace agreement. The deal gave Chechnya substantial autonomy but not full independence. The Chechen chief of staff, Aslan Maskhadov, was elected president.
However, Russia failed to invest in reconstruction. Maskhadov could not control brutal warlords who grew rich by organised crime and kidnapping. Many victims were murdered by their captors.

In August 1999, Chechen fighters crossed into the neighbouring Russian Republic of Dagestan to support a declaration by an Islamic body based there of an independent Islamic state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya. This body also called on all Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war. By now Vladimir Putin was Russian prime minister and Moscow was fast and firm in its reaction. Within a couple of weeks the rebellion was over.
The late summer of the same year saw several explosions in Russia in which hundreds died. The Russian authorities did not hesitate to blame the Chechens.
Mr Putin sent the army back to subdue the republic by force in a second brutal campaign which, despite Russian claims of victory, has yet to reach a conclusion.
Western criticism of Russian tactics and human rights violations in Chechnya was all but silenced following the 11 September attacks on the US. Russia has since portrayed Chechen rebel forces as part of the global terror network and uses this to vindicate its methods.
A controversial referendum in March 2003 approved a new constitution, giving Chechnya more autonomy but stipulating that it remained firmly part of Russia. Moscow ruled out participation by the armed opposition and there were widespread concerns that the republic was far too unstable to ensure a valid outcome.
Parliamentary elections in November 2005 saw the pro-Kremlin United Russia party win over half the seats. Separatist rebels dismissed the election as a charade but President Putin said that the legal process of restoring constitutional order had been completed.
Since then there has been increased investment in reconstruction projects and the shattered city of Groznyy is being rebuilt. While Russia is keen to highlight these signs of rebirth, sporadic violence continues.
In April 2009, Moscow announced that the situation in Chechnya had improved to such extent that it felt able to end its military operation against the rebels.

Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of the French, was born in Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica's southern departement. The Maison Bonaparte in the town is now a museum. The island's architectural features include Genoese fortresses, watchtowers and baroque churches.
Local culture finds expression in folk music and handicrafts. The Tuscan-influenced Corsican language is taught in the island's schools.
The island is studded with standing stones and other monuments, evidence of human occupation in neolithic times. The Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans all left their mark. Vandals, Goths and Moors were among the later invaders.
The Genoese from Italy ruled Corsica from the 1400s-1700s, and occasionally came to blows with the local aristocracy, nationalists and the French. A nationalist rebellion led to the foundation of a Corsican republic in 1755. But independence was short-lived; the Genoese ceded the island to France, whose troops invaded in 1769.

Corsica is one of France's least-developed regions and receives large subsidies from Paris. Tourism is an important part of the island's economy, but large stretches of the seaboard remain undeveloped. Much of the population is concentrated in the main towns of Bastia and Ajaccio.
Separatist groups seeking greater autonomy for the island carried out bombing campaigns from the mid-1970s, often targeting police stations and administrative buildings. In 1998 France's top official on the island was assassinated.
A referendum organised by the French government to consolidate the two administrative divisions of Corsica into a single region with enhanced powers narrowly failed to win approval in 2003.
In March 2005 the main separatist faction - the FLNC-Union of Combatants - broke off an open-ended ceasefire that it had declared in late 2003. There was a spate of minor bomb attacks around the time of the presidential elections in April and May 2007.

Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine The Great in 1783 and remained part of Russia until 1954 when it was transferred to Ukraine under the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
Ethnic Russians still make up the bulk of the population, Ukrainians under a quarter and the Muslim Crimean Tatars about 12%.
Sevastopol: A key base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet
For centuries under Greek and Roman influence, Crimea in 1443 became the centre of a Tatar Khanate, which later became an Ottoman vassal state.
Rival imperial ambitions in the mid 19th century led to the Crimean War when Britain and France, suspicious of Russian ambitions in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire declined, sent troops.
Tatar deportation
Given autonomous republic status within Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, Crimea was occupied by the Nazis in the early 1940s.
The Tatars were accused of collaboration by Stalin and deported en masse to Central Asia and Siberia in 1944. Many did not survive.
Only as the Soviet Union collapsed were they allowed to return. By the time over a quarter of a million did so in the early 1990s, it was to an independent Ukraine where they faced very high unemployment and extremely poor housing conditions.
There have been persistent tensions and protests over land rights, and allocation of land to Crimean Tatars remains a highly contentious issue.
After Ukrainian independence, political figures from the local Russian community sought to assert sovereignty and strengthen ties with Russia through a series of moves declared unconstitutional by Kiev.
Yalta: The port city is a mecca for tourists
The 1996 Ukrainian constitution stipulated that Crimea would have autonomous republic status but reasserted that Crimean legislation must be in keeping with that of Ukraine.
Crimea has its own parliament and government with powers over agriculture, public infrastructure and tourism.
The Crimean Tatars have their own unofficial parliament, the Mejlis, which states its purpose as being to promote the rights and interests of the Crimean Tatars.
Ukraine-Russia tension
The port of Sevastopol is a major naval base and has been home to the Black Sea Fleet since Soviet times. Following the collapse of the USSR, the fleet was divided up between Russia and Ukraine.
The continuing presence of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol has been a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. In 2008, Ukraine - then under the pro-Western President Viktor Yuschenko - demanded that Moscow not use the Black Sea Fleet during the its conflict with Georgia.
Both countries had agreed to allow the Russian fleet to stay until 2017, but after the election of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych as president in 2010, Ukraine agreed to extend the lease by 25 years beyond 2017, in return for cheaper Russian gas.
There was also friction over plans - later scrapped by Mr Yanukovych - by Mr Yushchenko to strengthen ties with Nato. In 2006, ethnic Russians took to the streets to disrupt preparations for Nato-led naval exercises off Crimea.
There is a rumbling border dispute between Moscow and Kiev in the Kerch Strait. Tensions rose sharply in late 2003 after Russia started building a causeway between the Russian coast and the island of Tuzla, just off Crimea.

Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries.
The Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups.
The republic's constitution declares the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan's peoples to be a fundamental principle. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in what is Russia's most ethnically diverse province.
The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized crime and regional instability. The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia. They live in the shadow of lawlessness and the threat of violence.
History
Dagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil, the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. The name of Imam Shamil is still revered by many in both republics.
Russia tries to police Caucasus peaks
When the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. During the Stalinist period its peoples escaped the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities have been regarded as loyal by the Kremlin and as corrupt and incompetent by many elsewhere. Oil and caviar mafias are reported to flourish. Kidnappings and violence are commonplace. Firearms are ubiquitous and assassinations are a regular event.
Moscow consistently says it sees the hand of Chechen-based separatism as the cause. Others see the roots in lust for profit against a background of lawlessness in a gun culture.
Budennovsk and beyond
Chechen warlords, ever eager to make trouble for Moscow, have openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions.
These attracted international attention for the first time in 1995 and 1996 when Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduyev crossed the border and seized hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar in the name of the separatist cause. Scores died and the Kremlin now finds it hard to come to terms with the fact that Basayev and Raduyev got away.
Gun law is powerful in Dagestan
The Muslims of Dagestan, for whom Sufism combined with local tradition is the main faith, have generally been anxious to avoid the conflict that has afflicted Chechnya.
However, in the latter part of the 1990s there were reports that more radical and militant elements, said to be linked with Wahhabism, were acquiring influence. There was tension when two mountain villages near the Chechen border sought to introduce Shari'ah law in 1998.
Violence flared in August 1999 when an Islamic body was reported to have declared an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya and called on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war. It also called for the arrest of Magomedali Magomedov, the republic's leader at the time, accusing him of working with the Russians.
Russian forces prepare to fight in 1999
Chechen fighters crossed into Dagestan in support. There were fierce clashes with Russian forces but within a couple of weeks the fighting was over. The militants were silenced. This incident contributed heavily to the return of Russian troops to Chechnya.
The republic has seen numerous bombings targeted at the Russian military which has forces stationed at Kaspiysk, Buynaksk and Budennovsk. Scores were killed in 1996 and 1999 in Kaspiysk and Buynaksk when bombs went off near blocks of flats housing Russian officers. Dozens more died in 2002 when bombers targeted a Russian military parade in Kaspiysk.
Russian forces have since been the target of numerous smaller scale attacks. At least 10 died in a bomb blast in the capital, Makhachkala in July 2005. Violence continues: a leading journalist was killed in 2008, and in 2009 a senior police investigator and the republic's interior minister were shot dead.
Russia accused a Dagestan militant, Magomedali Vagabov, of being behind the attack on the Moscow metro in March 2010 in which 39 people were killed. The attack was carried out by two female suicide bombers from Dagestan. In August 2010, Russian forces killed Vagabov in a counter-terrorism operation in Dagestan.
The Kremlin is not alone in blaming Islamic militants for orchestrating the violence. Many say organized crime is the crucial factor. Clan and political rivalries are seen as another ingredient.
As concerns grow over the volatility of the North Caucasus, lawless Dagestan offers little short-term hope of stability.

But a planned referendum on the issue was shelved in 2001 after Denmark said it would halt aid within four years if voters favoured the independence proposals.
A local parliament looks after the islands' affairs, although Copenhagen is responsible for defence and foreign relations.
The Faroes were first settled by Irish monks in the 6th century AD. The first Norse settlers were farmers.
The islands became part of the Kingdom of Norway in the 11th century and came under Danish control in the 14th century when Norway joined the Kingdom of Denmark. Under the 1948 Home Rule Act the islands became self-governing.
The islanders' traditional hunt for pilot whales has attracted international attention. Supporters of the hunt say whale meat is an important source of food over the winter. Animal rights activists have called for the cull to be banned.
Fishing is the main economic activity on the islands, and Danish subsidies remain an important source of income. Copenhagen has said it will review the subsidy agreement should the Faroes profit from offshore energy reserves.

286;"Named in Arabic ""Jabal Tariq"", after the Muslim commander Tariq Ibn-Ziyad, who turned ""the Rock"" into a fortress in 711, Gibraltar has been an important naval base for more than 1,000 years.
Gibraltar: Seafaring traditions span the centuries
This long maritime history has resulted in a diverse population. Most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish, and are of mixed Genoese, British, Spanish, Maltese and Portuguese descent. Recent arrivals have included migrant workers from Morocco.
Gibraltarians are British citizens. They elect their own representatives to the territory's House of Assembly; the British monarch appoints a governor. Gibraltar is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy. It is home to a British military garrison and naval base.
The EU has pressured Spain and Britain to resolve the issue of Gibraltar's status. Both sides, under the Brussels Process launched in 1984, have attempted to reach an agreement.
But Spain's insistence on eventually acquiring full sovereignty, and Britain's determination to retain full control of Gibraltar's military base, have been among the stumbling blocks.
Gibraltar's 1969 constitution states that there can be no transfer of sovereignty to Spain against the wishes of locals. In a 2002 referendum Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected the idea of joint sovereignty. Spain and Britain were said to have reached ""broad agreement"" on the concept.
Passenger flights between Spain and Gibraltar were blocked for nearly 30 years
Free travel between Spain and Gibraltar was fully restored in 1985, but travellers continued to suffer delays at the border. In late 2006, passenger flights between Spain and Gibraltar resumed for the first time in nearly 30 years.
The air link was restored after Gibraltar, Spain and Britain signed agreements aimed at improving living conditions on the Rock. The three-way talks did not cover the issue of sovereignty.
With no large-scale agricultural or industrial activity, much of Gibraltar's income comes from customs duties, offshore finance, internet gaming, tourism and the provisioning of ships.

287;"The climate in Greenland is extremely harsh. More than 80% of the island is covered by an ice cap which is 4km thick in places.
Uummannaq locals enjoy perpetual daylight for two months each year
Many of the Eskimo (Inuit) people survive by hunting and fishing and are struggling as fish stocks become depleted. The island's population is only 57,000. Inhabitants face severe social problems, notably unemployment, alcoholism and HIV/Aids.
Recent environmental studies have raised fears that global warming is causing Greenland's ice cover to melt increasingly fast and that this could have serious implications for future sea levels and ocean currents unless the process is rapidly halted and then reversed.
US plans for a national missile defence system have highlighted the strategic importance of Greenland. The Americans have expressed interest in using their Cold War radar base at Thule in the north of the island as part of this defence system.
Dozens of Inuit families were forced off their lands in 1953 to allow expansion at the base. Many Greenlanders would like to see it closed down. Others see economic reasons for keeping it.
A substantial proportion of Greenland's population favours independence. However, the former colonial power, Denmark, has the final say on the matter.
In 2008 Greenlanders voted in a referendum for more autonomy. The deal gave them greater control over their energy resources, treated Greenlanders as a separate people under international law, and granted the native Inuit language Kalaallisut (Western Greenlandic) official status in place of Danish. The Danish subsidy is to continue.
Early elections were held just before that deal came into force in June 2009 in order to decide how to implement it. The pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party beat the Social Democratic Siumut party, which had governed for 30 years.

The Ingush and Chechen peoples have close historical, cultural and linguistic ties, although the Ingush have not shared in the fierceness of the resistance to Moscow put up by the Chechens over the past 200 years.
Part of the Russian empire since the early 19th century, Ingushetia was formally joined to Chechnya under Soviet rule in 1936 when it formed around one-fifth of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic within Russia.
Like the Chechens, the Ingush, despite their history of relative loyalty to Moscow, were deported to Central Asia towards the end of World War II by Stalin who accused them of collaborating with the Nazis. They were allowed to return only in 1957 when Khrushchev was Soviet leader.
There was tension after Dzhokhar Dudayev came to power as Chechen leader in 1991. When he declared Chechen sovereignty the Ingush resisted. There was some fighting along the border between the two regions and Russian troops were sent in to establish order. The Ingush subsequently voted in a referendum to form the Republic of Ingushetia within Russia. Although firmly tied to Moscow, the republic has its own anthem and state symbols.
The Ingush and North Ossetians have a history of rivalry. Ingushetia lays claim to the neighbouring Prigorodny district which was included in the Russian Republic of North Ossetia when Stalin deported the Ingush in 1944. For many years after their return, the district had a substantial Ingush population.
Post-Soviet period
In late 1992 violence erupted in Prigorodny district. The two sides have fundamental differences as to the reasons. The North Ossetians assert that it was sparked by Ingush radicals seeking to include Prigorodny in the newly formed Republic of Ingushetia. The Ingush assert that the North Ossetians attacked first and that they acted in self defence.
The fighting left many dead. Moscow sent troops to establish order. The Ingush population was expelled from the district and Ingushetia faced its first post-independence refugee crisis. Tensions persist and there are differences as to how many refugees have returned home.
Post-Soviet Ingushetia has had to deal with several refugee crises
Another refugee crisis presented itself when thousands of Chechens fled across the border into Ingushetia when Russian troops returned to Chechnya in 1999. The last refugee camp was reported to have been closed five years later. Russia rejected concerns voiced by human rights groups that many of the former residents had been forcibly repatriated in Moscow's zeal to expunge indications of continuing conflict in the area.
Ingushetia lives in the shadow of the instability of its Chechen neighbour and poverty is widespread. From time to time, the violence has spilled over the border and Russian forces are regularly targeted by attackers.
There was a major escalation in June 2004 when several dozen people, including the Ingush acting interior minister, were killed in attacks reported to have involved hundreds of gunmen armed with grenades and rockets. The incident, and subsequent clashes, prompted the Kremlin to order a change of leadership in a bid to reduce the level of violence.
However, there was a renewed spate of attacks by militants in 2009, including a suicide bombing at a police station that killed at least 25 people - the deadliest attack in the republic since 2005 - and an attempt on the life of President Yunus-Bek Yevkurov. Moscow reacted by announcing another overhaul of security in the republic.

The Isle of Man was permanently settled by Celts and fell under Viking control in 1079. The Viking legacy is seen in many place names and the title of the Tynwald parliament, although the Celtic Manx language predominated until the 19th century.
Man passed to the Scottish crown in 1266, and then to the feudal lordship of the Stanley family under the English crown. The British crown acquired the lordship in 1764, but never incorporated the island into the United Kingdom.
Tourism plays a significant role in the economy
The Tynwald parliament was granted autonomy in 1866, and steadily advanced to democracy in step with the United Kingdom. Established no later than 979, it is one of various assemblies that claim to be the oldest parliament in the world. The Tynwald elects the Council of Ministers, presided over since 1986 by a chief minister. Most members of the Tynwald are independents.
Native-born people make up 47.6 per cent of the population, with the rest almost entirely accounted for by immigrants from the United Kingdom. People born in England make up 37.2 per cent alone.
As a Crown Dependency, the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom or European Union. The Tynwald passes its own legislation with the assent of the Crown granted in the Privy Council. The Crown is responsible for defence and diplomatic representation, and acts on the advice of the UK Ministry of Justice. The Isle of Man has its own controls on immigration and housing.
The Isle of Man has relatively low taxes and this has encouraged a major offshore financial sector that accounts for most of GDP. Over recent years the Manx government has made a concerted effort to cast off the island's reputation as a tax haven, signing tax information exchange deals with over a dozen countries.
Its strategy was rewarded in April 2009 when it was included in an OECD ""white list"" of jurisdictions meeting international standards on taxation.
Inclusion in the list came just a few months after British Chancellor Alistair Darling dubbed the island a ""tax haven sitting in the Irish Sea"". The British government has subsequently praised the island's efforts at improving financial transparency.
Light industry and tourism also play a significant role in the economy, while agriculture and fisheries are steadily losing their significance.
The Manx government has boosted the island as a location for film and TV productions, and more than 80 films have been made there since 1995.

Since the 2004 school siege at Beslan in neighbouring North Ossetia, Russia has repeatedly targeted what it says are Islamic extremists operating in Kabardino-Balkaria.
Mosques in the capital, Nalchik, have been closed and there have been armed operations against suspected Islamic militants, some of whom have been killed, along with members of the security forces.
In October 2005 militants staged a large-scale, armed assault on government buildings in Nalchik. Russia responded swiftly, deploying hundreds of troops and special forces with orders to shoot to kill. Many dozens were reported dead, including militants, civilians and Russian forces.
Security forces have targeted suspected Islamic militants
Yarmuk, a local militant Islamic group with Chechen links, said that its fighters had been involved on the ground as part of a Caucasus Front.
The organisation of a Caucasus Front against Russia was decreed in May 2005 by the late Chechen rebel leader Abdul-Khalim Saydullayev. The decree was perceived as a bid further to widen Chechnya's conflict with Russia.
Kabardino-Balkaria is home to the two highest peaks in the North Caucasus, Mount Elbrus and Dykh Tau. It shares a border with Georgia. To the east and west lie the Russian republics of North Ossetia and Karachayevo-Cherkessia. To the north is Stavropol region. It lies 50km west of war-torn Chechnya.
The area was contested by the Russian and Ottoman empires between the 17th and 19th centuries when it came under Russian control. After the Bolshevik revolution, the Kabardino Autonomous Region was formed in 1921, and the Balkar district added a year later. The region gained autonomous republic status in 1936.
The population is made up of mainly-Muslim Kabardins, as well as minorities of Turkic-speaking Balkars - around 10% of the people - and Russians. There is friction between the Kabardins and the Balkars, and in 1992 the Balkars voted for secession.
Accused by Stalin of collaboration with the Nazis, the Balkars were deported to Central Asia during World War II and their name was dropped from the republic's title. It was restored in 1957 when they were allowed to return. The region became a federal republic of Russia in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR.
The economy relies heavily on subsidies from Moscow.

Regions and territories: Kaliningrad
The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea is sandwiched between Poland to the south and Lithuania to the north and east.
Annexed from Germany in 1945, the territory was a closed military zone throughout the Soviet period.
In 2008, Russia threatened to deploy short-range missiles there if the United States went ahead with its plan to build controversial missile defence bases in Poland and the Czech Republic.
OVERVIEW
Koenigsberg, as the city of Kaliningrad was once known, was founded by Teutonic knights in the 13th century. It became one of the cities of the Hanseatic League and was once the capital of Prussia. The philosopher Immanuel Kant spent all his life in the city and died there in 1804.
The region was part of Germany until annexation by the USSR following World War II when it saw bitter fighting and suffered rampant destruction. The German population was expelled or fled after the war ended.
Kaliningrad has strategic importance for Moscow
During the Soviet period, Kaliningrad Region, administratively part of the Russian Federation, was separated from the rest of Russia, more than 300km to the east, by the then Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus.
Since Lithuania joined the EU it has been impossible to travel between the exclave and the rest of Russia over land without crossing the territory of at least one EU state. There has been friction, particularly with Lithuania, over transit regulations. President Putin described as a matter of Russian national security the inauguration of a new sea route linking the region with Ust-Luga, near St Petersburg, in 2006.
Kaliningrad was one of the most militarised and closed parts of the Soviet Union. Up to half a million servicemen were stationed there. The military were the region's chief economic mainstay in the Soviet years. When the USSR ceased to be, that military presence was decimated along with the economic benefits it provided.
Kaliningrad is still of great strategic importance to Moscow. It houses the Russian Baltic Fleet at the port of Baltiysk and is the country's only European ice-free port.
Uneven development
The economy has experienced both ups and downs
During the Soviet period, agriculture was a key industry. The market for Kaliningrad's produce was largely dismantled with the collapse of the USSR. The economy nosedived in the early 1990s. Russia provided very little real investment. Unemployment soared and poverty became very widespread, particularly in rural areas. Organised crime and drugs became increasingly problematic. HIV infection rates rose.
In a bid to tackle the region's problems, in 1996 the Russian authorities granted it special economic status and tax advantages intended to attract investors. Although corruption was an early deterrent, the region's economy benefited substantially.
Kaliningrad underwent an unprecedented boom, and in 2007 a new $45m airport terminal was opened.
The European Commission provides funds for business projects under its special programme for Kaliningrad. The region began to see increasing trade with the countries of the EU as well as increasing economic growth and rising industrial output.
However, the global financial crisis of 2008-9 affected the region badly, and by the beginning of 2010 unemployment had climbed to over 10% - considerably higher than the Russian average.
Rumblings of discontent came to a head after a sharp increase in the cost of public transport, and in January an estimated 10,000 people attended a rally calling for the dismissal of Kaliningrad governor Georgiy Boos, in what was one of the biggest opposition protests in Russia in a decade.
Moscow keeps a wary eye on developments. The Kremlin is particularly sensitive over calls from within the region for a referendum on whether to seek greater autonomy within Russia with a view to strengthening ties with the European Union.

Head of the republic: Kirsan Ilyumzhinov
A Buddhist millionaire businessman with a reputation of eccentricity, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has ruled Kalmykia virtually unchallenged since 1993.
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has led Kalmykia since 1993
He was elected president at the age of just over 30 after promising voters $100 each, and pledging to introduce what he called an ""economic dictatorship"" in the republic.
Soon after his election, Mr Ilyumzhinov introduced presidential rule, concentrating power in his own hands. He was re-elected unopposed in 1995 and again in 2002.
In line with new legislation on the appointment of regional leaders, Mr Ilyumzhinov resigned and was re-nominated by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005. The Kalmyk parliament endorsed the move.
In 2010, eyebrows were raised when he claimed in a TV interview that he had been abducted by aliens and taken aboard their spaceship back in 1997.
The comments are thought to have cast a shadow over his efforts to be re-nominated as president in October 2010, when his current term runs out.
Mr Iyumzhinov denies persistent accusations of diverting the republic's resources for his own use as well as of human rights abuses and of suppressing media freedom. When Larisa Yudina, editor of the republic's only opposition newspaper was murdered in 1998, he strenuously rejected allegations of involvement.
In 2004 police dispersed demonstrators who had accused him of human rights violations and demanded his resignation.
Mr Ilyumzhinov acquired his wealth in the economic free-for-all which followed the collapse of the USSR.
He has been president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) since 1995 and has been enthusiastic about attracting international tournaments to Kalmykia. His flamboyant plans to build an extravagant Chess City in the republic have led to protests by its impoverished citizens.

Regions and territories: Karachay-Cherkessia
The Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia lies in the northwest of Russia's troubled North Caucasus region. To the north and west lie the Russian territories of Stavropol and Krasnodar.
From the lowland steppes of the north, the ground rises to the southern border with Georgia which runs through the Caucasus mountain peaks.
The Karachay and Cherkess are two separate Muslim peoples. The Cherkess are ethnically and culturally related to the Kabarda and Adygey peoples and the Karachay to the Balkars. The republic is also home to Abazin and Nogay minorities. Ethnic tensions flare sporadically.
History
The region was absorbed by an expanding Russian Empire in the first half of the 19th century.
In the 20th, the divide-and-rule tactics of the Stalin era involved weakening resistance by splitting related groups and joining unrelated ones in shared administrative units. As part of this pattern, the Karachay-Cherkessia Autonomous Region was first created in 1922. Several further administrative adjustments and readjustments followed.
In 1943 the Karachay people were deported to Central Asia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. They were allowed back in 1957 and the Karachay-Cherkess autonomous region recreated.
Although it has not experienced the levels of violence seen elsewhere in the North Caucasus, the republic lives in the shadow of the troubles which have plagued the region. Russian forces have mounted numerous security operations and reported foiling intended attacks by Islamist militants.
Crime, sometimes violent, and corruption further undermine stability. Inter-clan rivalries simmer and occasionally surface in angry outbursts. Poverty is widespread.
Karachay-Cherkessia gained republic status in the early 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Soviet-era Communist leader Vladimir Khubiyev was re-appointed as president by Boris Yeltsin.
He remained in the post until the republic's first direct presidential elections in 1999 when Vladimir Semenov, a Karachay and former commander of Russian ground forces, defeated the late Stanislav Derev, a Cherkess businessman. The vote was followed by furious protests and allegations of fraud.
Crisis flared again in November 2004 following the brutal killing of seven businessmen in controversial circumstances. The former son-in-law of then President Mustafa Batdyyev was later convicted or organizing the murders.
The republic is keen to develop its tourist industry and winter sports are particularly popular. The highest peak in the Caucasus, Mount Elbrus, lies on the border with Kabardino-Balkaria.

294;"President: Fatmir Sejdiu (resigned)
Caretaker president: Jakup Krasniqi
Fatmir Sejdiu was elected by parliament in February 2006. The leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), he was the sole candidate.
Fatmir Sejdiu stepped down in September 2010
Mr Sejdiu resigned in September 2010, after a court ruling that he had acted unconstitutionally by keeping a party post while in office. The following month, Mr Sejdiu's party pulled out of the governing coalition, in which it was the junior partner to Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's PDK.
Mr Sejdiu was a close ally of the former president, writer-turned-politician Ibrahim Rugova, who died of cancer just days before UN-mediated talks on Kosovo's future status began in February 2006.
Ibrahim Rugova was nicknamed the ""Gandhi of the Balkans"". He led an ethnic Albanian campaign of passive resistance against Serb rule in the 1990s. He was twice elected president in unofficial elections, and won official presidential elections in 2002.
Mr Sejdiu was born near the town of Podujevo in northern Kosovo. He studied law in France and the US and speaks both English and French.
Prime minister: Hashim Thaci
Hashim Thaci is a veteran of the ethnic Albanians' drive to break away from Serbia.
Mr Thaci's minority government fell in November 2010
He began agitating for the Kosovo Albanian cause while still in his teens, and first came to prominence as the political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the guerrilla group that took up arms against Serb forces in the late 1990s.
He became known outside Kosovo when he formed part of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team at internationally-sponsored peace talks at Rambouillet, France, early in 1999.
He made such a powerful impression at the talks that he succeeded in sidelining veteran Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova - who was more in favour of passive resistance to Serbia - and was appointed leader of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team.
After the talks broke down and NATO launched its air campaign against Serbia that resulted in Kosovo becoming a UN protectorate, Mr Rugova reasserted his authority within the province and officially became president in 2002.
Meanwhile, Mr Thaci underwent a gradual process of transformation from fiery left-wing guerrilla to respectable politician. His Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) emerged out of the KLA and finally won an election in November 2007.
Some analysts believe that the years spent by Mr Thaci as prime minister-in-waiting allowed him to hone his political skills and made him into one of the province's most moderate leaders.
On being elected prime minister, he made an attempt to reach out to Kosovo's dwindling Serbian minority by switching to speaking Serbian as he called on the Serbs to consider Kosovo their home.
Mr Thaci's party consolidated its position in local elections in November 2009, in a vote that was seen as a crucial test of the democratic credentials of the Kosovo government.
The governing coaltion collapsed in October 2010 when the junior partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), withdrew.
The following month, parliament passed a vote of no-confidence in Mr Thaci's minority government, and snap elections were set for 12 December.
Hasim Thaci was born in 1968 in the Drenica region, a stronghold of the ethnic Albanian revolt against Serbia.
He was a student activist in 1989-91, and later went underground to join the KLA, which was formed in 1993. It was at that time that he acquired the nom de guerre of ""the Snake"" on account of his success in evading capture.
He is married, with one son.

295;"The ongoing bitter rivalry for control between ethnic Armenians and Azeris has roots dating back well over a century into competition between Christian Armenian and Muslim Turkic and Persian influences.
AT-A-GLANCE
Territory is inside Azerbaijan, but population is mainly ethnic Armenian
War followed 1991 declaration of independence; up to 30,000 killed, more than one million fled their homes
Relations continued to be strained after 1994 ceasefire; first signs of a thaw appeared in 2008
Populated for hundreds of years by Armenian and Turkic farmers, herdsmen and traders, Karabakh became part of the Russian empire in the 19th century.
Armenia insists that it was part of an early Christian kingdom, citing the presence of ancient churches as evidence. Azeri historians argue that the churches were built by the Caucasian Albanians, a Christian nation whom they regard as among the forebears of the Azeri people.
Islam arrived in the region more than a millennium ago.
For long periods Christian Armenians and Turkic Azeris lived in peace but they were both guilty of acts of brutality in the early 20th century. These live on in the popular memory and fuel mutual antagonism.
There have been many deaths to mourn
The end of World War I and the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia brought carving up of borders. As part of their divide-and-rule policy in the area, the Soviets established the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, of which the population was predominantly ethnic Armenian, within Azerbaijan in the early 1920s.
Armenian discontent at this situation smouldered throughout the Soviet period. Ethnic Armenian-Azeri frictions exploded into furious violence in the late 1980s in the twilight years of the USSR.
As the violence escalated, the ethnic Azeri population fled Karabakh and Armenia while ethnic Armenians fled the rest of Azerbaijan. With the break-up of the Soviet Union, in late 1991, Karabakh declared itself an independent republic. That de facto status remains unrecognised elsewhere.
Although there was no formal declaration of war, there was large-scale combat between Azerbaijani and ethnic Armenian forces. That fighting ultimately brought victory for the ethnic Armenians who then pushed on to occupy Azerbaijani territory outside Karabakh, creating a buffer zone linking Karabakh and Armenia.
Ceasefire
A Russian-brokered ceasefire was signed in 1994 leaving Karabakh de facto under ethnic Armenian control. The deal also left swathes of Azeri territory around the enclave in Armenian hands. No final settlement has ever been signed. Both sides have had soldiers killed in sporadic breaches of the ceasefire. The closure of borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan has caused landlocked Armenia severe economic problems for nearly 15 years.
The territory's future is unresolved
It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people lost their lives during half a decade of conflict, and that more than one million fled their homes. The Azeris have yet to return to areas of Azerbaijan now under ethnic Armenian control and have little prospect of returning to Karabakh itself. Similarly, the Armenians who fled Azerbaijan during the conflict have not returned there.
The ethnic Armenians who now account for virtually the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh prefer to call it Artsakh, an ancient name dating back around 1,500 years.
The situation throughout over a decade since the ceasefire agreement has been one of simmering stalemate. Azeris bitterly resent the loss of the land which they regard as rightfully theirs. The Armenians show no sign of willingness to compromise or give one square centimetre of it back.
Russia, France and the US co-chair the OSCE's Minsk Group, which has been attempting to broker an end to the dispute for over a decade.
In 1997 the group tabled settlement proposals seen as a starting point for negotiations by Azerbaijan and Armenia but not by the de facto authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh itself. When the then Armenian president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, tried to encourage Nagorno-Karabakh to enter into talks he was forced to resign amid cries of betrayal.
Thaw
Azerbaiijan declared illegitimate a referendum held in the region in December 2006. The vote approved a new constitution and referred to Karabakh as a sovereign state. Nonetheless, there have since been signs of life in the peace process, with occasional meetings between the Armenian and Azeri presidents.
These contacts have yet to bear fruit, though Armenia's Serzh Sarkisian and Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev agreed in November 2008 to intensify their efforts to find a political settlement. Significant progress was made at talks between the two leaders in May and November 2009, though there are still a number of hurdles to be overcome.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the attackers were international terrorists with links to Chechen separatists and funding from al-Qaeda. He accused them of seeking to unleash violence across the North Caucasus in order to strike at Russia's south.
Ousted Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov, who was killed just six months later, condemned the seizure of the school but blamed Russian policy in Chechnya, describing the attackers as ""madmen"" seeking to avenge the Chechen people for atrocities carried out by Russians.
Remembering the victims: The Beslan siege ended in a bloodbath
The only attacker thought to have survived was later sentenced to life imprisonment. Campaigners continue to accuse the Russian authorities of a cover-up and want further investigation into events leading up to and during the siege.
History
Ethnic Ossetians and Russians make up most of the population of North Ossetia. Russian influence in the area increased in the 18th century with the founding of a military outpost at Vladikavkaz.
In the early 1920s the territory was part of the short-lived Soviet Mountain Republic - made up of six districts including Chechnya and Ingushetia. Autonomous status was given to the districts in 1924; in 1936 North Ossetia became an autonomous Soviet republic.
North Ossetia has a history of loyalty to Moscow but this has not exempted it from internal conflict and violence in recent years.
A nail bomb attack on the central market in the capital Vladikavkaz in 1999, which killed 60 people, was blamed on Muslim extremists. Russian military targets in North Ossetia have been attacked on several occasions in recent years with scores of personnel killed.
North Ossetia fought a bloody conflict with its eastern neighbour, the Russian republic of Ingushetia, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Ingush forces, in pursuit of a historical claim to Prigorodny district on the right bank of the Terek river, were repelled in 1992 with the support of Moscow. Hundreds died in the fighting, and many ethnic Ingush civilians fled North Ossetia for Ingushetia. A peace agreement has yet to be reached.
The North Ossetian and Ingush sides have made conflicting claims about the extent of the return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia.
Ossetians divided
War broke out in the South Ossetia region of Georgia, just over the border from North Ossetia, in August 2008. Russian forces drove Georgian troops out of the region, which declared independence from Georgia in 1991 and has been run by a secessionist government ever since.
Thousands of South Ossetians fled to the North in the 1990s amid the violence that followed the declaration of independence. North Ossetia maintains strong ethnic links with the territory.
Rich in resources - including unexploited oil and gas reserves - North Ossetia is the most industrialised and urbanised republic in the North Caucasus. It also has tourism potential; plans for a ski resort were announced in 2003.

Georgia is adamant that there can be no compromise over South Ossetia being part of Georgia, to the extent of avoiding the use of the name South Ossetia, which it sees as implying political bonds with North Ossetia, which lies in Russia.
The 2008 conflict left much of the capital Tskhinvali in ruins
Insisting that North Ossetia is, in fact, the only Ossetia, Tbilisi prefers to call South Ossetia by the ancient name of Samachablo or, more recently, Tskhinvali Region.
In August 2008, Georgia's efforts to regain control of the area seem to have suffered a crippling blow when Russia - a staunch ally of South Ossetia's separatists - defeated a Georgian incursion into South Ossetia in a bloody five-day conflict.
History
The Ossetians are believed to be descended from tribes which migrated into the area from Asia many hundreds of years ago and settled in what is now North Ossetia.
As the Russian empire expanded into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Ossetians did not join other peoples of the North Caucasus in putting up fierce resistance.
By tradition, the Ossetians have had good relations with Russians and were regarded as loyal citizens, first of the Russian empire and later of the Soviet Union.
They sided with the Kremlin when Bolshevik forces occupied Georgia in the early 1920s and, as part of the carve-up which followed, the South Ossetian Autonomous Region was created in Georgia and North Ossetia was formed in Russia.
Violence flares
In the twilight of the Soviet Union, as Georgian nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to prominence in Tbilisi, separatist sentiment burgeoned in South Ossetian.
Russian troops were welcomed as liberators in the 2008 conflict
After several outbreaks violence between Georgians and Ossetians, the region declared its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 and, the following year, effective independence.
The collapse of the USSR and Georgian independence in 1991 only strengthened South Ossetia's determination to break with Tbilisi.
Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continued until the summer of 1992 when agreement on the deployment of Georgian, Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers was reached.
Political stalemate followed. Separatist voices became less strident during President Shevardnadze's rule in Georgia, but the issues returned to the foreground when Mikhail Saakashvili replaced him as president.
Making clear his intention to bring the breakaway regions to heel, Mr Saakashvili offered South Ossetia dialogue and autonomy within a single Georgian state
But his offer fell far short of separatist demands, and in 2006 South Ossetians overwhelmingly voted to restate their demand for independence in an unrecognised referendum.
Tensions came to head in early August 2008, when, after nearly a week of clashes between Georgian troops and separatist forces, Georgia launched an devastating air and ground assault attack on South Ossetia, briefly gaining control of Tskhinvali.
Georgian forces fire a rocket during the brief war with Russia in 2008
Declaring its citizens - most South Ossetians had Russian passports - to be under under attack, Russia sent in its troops and launched air attacks on the Georgian troops.
Within days, Russian forces had swept the Georgians out of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and then proceeded to occupy parts of Georgia, causing panic in Tbilisi.
Recognition
Following Western protests, Russia pulled its forces back towards South Ossetia and Abkhazia under a cease-fire agreement, but days later proceeded to formally recognise both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
In April 2009, Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, as well as those of Abkhazia.

298;"In a September 2006 referendum, unrecognised by Moldova and the international community, the region reasserted its demand for independence and also backed a plan eventually to join Russia.
AT-A-GLANCE
Territory broke away from Moldova after a bloody conflict
A majority of the population are Russian speakers
Russian troops are stationed in Trans-Dniester
In the post World War II carve-up of the region, Moscow created Moldova's forerunner, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, from two disparate elements: the mainly Russian-speaking Dniester region, formerly an autonomous part of Ukraine, and the neighbouring region of Bessarabia, which had been part of Romania from 1918-1940.
But in the Soviet Union's dying days, alarm grew in the Dniester region over growing Moldovan nationalism and the possible reunification of Moldova with Romania. A 1989 law which made Moldovan an official language added to the tension, and Trans-Dniester proclaimed its secession in September 1990.
The breakaway territory's paramilitary forces took over Moldovan public institutions in the area in 1991. Fighting intensified, culminating in a battle on the right bank of the Dniester in June 1992. Up to 700 people were killed in the conflict.
A ceasefire was signed in July 1992, and a 10-km demilitarised security zone was established. The settlement was enforced by the Russian 14th Army forces already stationed in Trans-Dniester.
Russian presence
The ongoing presence of Russian troops has been a stumbling block in peace talks and the West is concerned about the Soviet-era arsenal in the territory. A pull-out began in 2001 but was halted when Trans-Dniester blocked the dispatch of weapons. Subsequent agreements to resume failed to reach fruition.
Long-running talks supervised by the OSCE, Russia and Ukraine have yet to yield a political solution. Attempts by Moldova to exert economic pressure on the Dniester authorities have failed to produce the desired result.
Soviet symbols live on in Trans-Dniester
In 2004 a Russian-brokered plan, which would have made the presence of Russian troops permanent, sparked mass protests in Moldova and was shelved. Ukraine has since come up with settlement proposals but these too have stalled.
There are disputes over language issues. Though dominated by Russian-speakers, around 40% of the population in Trans-Dniester have Moldovan - which is virtually identical to Romanian - as a first language.
In 2004 the Trans-Dniester authorities forced some schools to close, ostensibly for using the Latin alphabet to teach Moldovan. The dispute sparked tit-for-tat measures, including economic sanctions and a rail blockade.
Trans-Dniester contains most of Moldova's industrial infrastructure, but its economic potential is limited by its international isolation. It has its own currency, constitution, parliament, flag and anthem. One of the last bastions of Soviet-style rhetoric, the territory has nonethless privatised some of its industrial enterprises.
The region is plagued by corruption, organised crime and smuggling. It has been accused of conducting illegal arms sales and of money laundering. Poverty is widespread.
